Community Chat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to talk about CKAN development, say hi to the CKAN developers and members of
the CKAN community on the public `CKAN chat on Gitter`_. Gitter is free and open-source, and
you can sign in using your GitHub, GitLab, or X (formerly known as Twitter) account.

The logs for the old `#ckan`_ IRC channel (2014 to 2018) can be found here:
https://github.com/ckan/irc-logs.

Wiki
~~~~

If you've figured out how to do something with CKAN and want to document it for
others, make a new page on the `CKAN wiki`_ and tell us about it on the
ckan-dev mailing list or on Gitter.
