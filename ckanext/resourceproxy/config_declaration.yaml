      This sets the upper file size limit for in-line previews.
      Increasing the value allows CKAN to preview larger files (e.g. PDFs) in-line;
      however, a higher value might cause time-outs, or unresponsive browsers for CKAN users
      with lower bandwidth.

      This sets size of the chunk to read and write when proxying.
      Raising this value might save some CPU cycles. It makes no sense to lower it
      below the page size, which is default.
