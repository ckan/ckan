v2.0 2013-05-10
===============

.. note:: Starting on v2.0, issue numbers with four digits refer to the old
 ticketing system at http://trac.ckan.org and the ones with three digits refer
 to GitHub issues. For example:

 * #3020 is http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/3020
 * #271 is https://github.com/okfn/ckan/issues/271

 Some GitHub issues URLs will redirect to GitHub pull request pages.

.. note:: v2.0 is a huge release so the changes listed here are just the
 highlights. Bug fixes are not listed.

Note: This version requires a requirements upgrade on source installations

Note: This version requires a database upgrade

Note: This version requires a Solr schema upgrade

Organizations based authorization (see :doc:`authorization`):
 CKAN's new "organizations" feature replaces the old authorization system
 with a new one based on publisher organizations. It replaces the "Publisher
 Profile and Workflow" feature from CKAN 1.X, any instances relying on it will
 need to be updated.

 * New organization-based authorization and organization of datasets
 * Supports private datasets
 * Publisher workflow
 * New authorization ini file options


New frontend (see :doc:`theming/index`):
 CKAN's frontend has been completely redesigned, inside and out. There is
 a new default theme and the template engine has moved from Genshi to
 Jinja2. Any custom templates using Genshi will need to be updated, although
 there is a :ref:`ckan.legacy_templates` setting to aid in the migration.

 * Block-based template inheritance
 * Custom jinja tags: {% ckan_extends %}, {% snippet %} and {% url_for %} (#2502, #2503)
 * CSS "primer" page for theme developers
 * We're now using LESS for CSS
 * Scalable font icons (#2563)
 * Social sharing buttons (google plus, facebook, twitter)
   (this replaces the ckanext-social extension)
 * Three-stage dataset creation form (#2501)
 * New `paster front-end-build` command does everything needed to build the
   frontend for a production CKAN site (runs `paster less` to compile the css
   files, `paster minify` to minify the css and js files, etc.)

Plugins & Extensions:
 * New plugins toolkit provides a stable set of utility and helper functions
   for CKAN plugins to depend on.
 * The IDatasetForm plugin interface has been redesigned (note: this breaks
   backwards-compatibility with existing IDatasetForm plugins) (#649)
 * Many IDatasetForm bugs were fixed
 * New example extensions in core, and better documentation for the relevant
   plugin interfaces: example_itemplatehelpers (#447),
   example_idatasetform (#2750), hopefully more to come in 2.1!
 * New IFacets interface that allows to modify the facets shown on various
   pages. (#400)
 * The get_action() function now automatically adds 'model' and 'session' to
   the context dict (this saves on boiler-plate code, and means plugins don't
   have to import ckan.model in order to call get_action()) (#172)

Activity Streams, Following & User Dashboard:
 * New visual design for activity streams (#2941)
 * Group activity streams now include activities for changes to any of the
   group's datasets (#1664)
 * Group activity streams now appear on group pages (previously they could
   only be retrieved via the api)
 * Dataset activity streams now appear on dataset pages (previously they could
   only be retrieved via the api) (#3024)
 * Users can now follow groups (previously you could only follow users or
   datasets) (#3005)
 * Activity streams and following are also supported for organizations (#505)
 * When you're logged into CKAN, you now get a notifications count in the
   top-right corner of the site, telling you how many new notifications you
   have on your dashboard. Clicking on the count takes you to your dashboard
   page to view your notifications. (#3009)
 * Optionally, you can also receive notifications by email when you have new
   activities on your dashboard (#1635)
 * Infinite scrolling of activity streams (if you scroll to the bottom of a
   an activity stream, CKAN will automatically load more activities) (#3018)
 * Redesigned user dashboard (#3028):

   - New dropdown-menu enables you to filter you dashboard activity stream to
     show only activities from a particular user, dataset, group or
     organization that you're following
   - New sidebar shows previews and unfollow buttons (when the activity stream
     is filtered)
 * New :ref:`ckan.activity_streams_enabled` config file setting allows you to
   disable the generation of activity streams (#654)

Data Preview:
 * PDF files preview (#2203)
 * JSON files preview
 * HTML pages preview (in an iframe) (#2888)
 * New plugin extension point that allows plugins to add custom data previews
   for different data types (#2961)
 * Improved Recline Data Explorer previews (CSV files, Excel files..)
 * Plain text files preview


API:
 * The Action API is now CKAN's default API, and the API documentation has
   been rewritten (#357)

Other highlights:
 * CKAN now has continuous integration testing at
   https://travis-ci.org/okfn/ckan/
 * Dataset pages now have <link rel="alternate" type="application/rdf+xml"
   links in the HTML headers, allows linked-data tools to find CKAN's RDF
   rendering of a dataset's metadata (#413)
 * CKAN's DataStore and Data API have been rewritten, and now use PostgreSQL
   instead of elasticsearch, so there's no need to install elasticsearch
   anymore (this feature was also back-ported to CKAN 1.8) (#2733)
 * New Config page for sysadmins (/ckan-admin/config) enables sysadmins to set
   the site title, tag line, logo, the intro text shown on the front page,
   the about text shown on the /about page, select a theme, and add custom
   CSS (#2302, #2781)
 * New `paster color` command for creating color schemes
 * Fanstatic integration (#2371):

   - CKAN now uses Fanstatic to specify required static resource files
     (js, css..) for web pages
   - Enables each page to only include the static files that it needs,
     reducing page loads
   - Enables CKAN to use bundled and minified static files, further reducing
     page loads
   - CKAN's new `paster minify` command is used to create minified js and
     css files (#2950) (also see `paster front-end-build`)
 * CKAN will now recognise common file format strings such as
   "application/json", "JSON", ".json" and "json" as a single file type "json"
   (#2416)
 * CKAN now supports internalization of strings in javascript files, the new
   `paster trans` command is used to pull translatable strings out of
   javascript files (#2774, #2750)
 * convert_to/from_extras have been fixed to not add quotes around strings (#2930)
 * Updated CKAN coding standards (#3020) and CONTRIBUTING.rst file
 * Built-in page view counting and 'popular' badges on datasets and resources
   There's also a paster command to export the tracking data to a csv file (#195)
 * Updated CKAN Coding Standards and new CONTRIBUTING.rst file
 * You can now change the sort ordering of datasets on the dataset search page

Deprecated and removed:
 * The IGenshiStreamFilter plugin interface is deprecated (#271), use the
   ITemplateHelpers plugin interface instead
 * The Model, Search and Util APIs are deprecated, use the Action API instead
 * Removed restrict_template_vars config setting (#2257)

v1.8 2012-10-19

Major
 * New 'follow' feature that allows logged in users to follow other users or
   datasets (#2304)
 * New user dashboard that shows an activity stream of all the datasets and
   users you are following. Thanks to Sven R. Kunze for his work on this (#2305)

   PostgreSQL as backend, it is more stable and fast and supports SQL queries

API changes and deprecation:
 * Template helper functions are now restricted by default. By default only
   those helper functions listed in lib.helpers.__allowed_functions__
   are available to templates. The full functions can still be made
   available by setting `ckan.restrict_template_vars = false` in your ini file.
   Only restricted functions will be allowed in future versions of CKAN.
 * Deprecated functions related to the old faceting data structure have
   been removed:  `helpers.py:facet_items()`, `facets.html:facet_sidebar()`,
   `facets.html:facet_list_items()`.
   Internal use of the old facets datastructure (attached to the context,
   `c.facets`) has been superseded by use of the improved facet data structure,
   `c.search_facets`.  The old data structure is still available on `c.facets`,
   but is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. (#2313)
