        :param title: title of the view type, will be displayed on the
            frontend. This should be translatable (ie wrapped on
            ``toolkit._('Title')``).
        :param default_title: default title that will be used if the view is
            created automatically (optional, defaults to 'View').
        :param default_description: default description that will be used if
            the view is created automatically (optional, defaults to '').
        :param icon: icon for the view type. Should be one of the
            `Font Awesome`_ types without the `fa fa-` prefix eg. `compass`
            (optional, defaults to 'picture').
        :param always_available: the view type should be always available when
            creating new views regardless of the format of the resource
            (optional, defaults to False).
        :param iframed: the view template should be iframed before rendering.
            You generally want this option to be True unless the view styles
            and JavaScript don't clash with the main site theme (optional,
            defaults to True).
        :param preview_enabled: the preview button should appear on the edit
            view form. Some view types have their previews integrated with the
            form (optional, defaults to False).
        :param full_page_edit: the edit form should take the full page width
            of the page (optional, defaults to False).
        :param schema: schema to validate extra configuration fields for the
            view (optional). Schemas are defined as a dictionary, with the
            keys being the field name and the values a list of validator
            functions that will get applied to the field. For instance::

                {

           * ``can_preview`` (``boolean``)
             ``True`` if the extension can preview the resource.

           * ``fixable`` (``string``)
             A string explaining how preview for the resource could be enabled,
             for example if the ``resource_proxy`` plugin was enabled.

           * ``quality`` (``int``)
             How good the preview is: ``1`` (poor), ``2`` (average) or
             ``3`` (good). When multiple preview extensions can preview the

        url if your preview requires the resource to be on the same domain

        the action will be chained to another function defined in plugins with a
        "first plugin wins" pattern, which means the first plugin declaring a
        chained action should be called first. Chained actions must be
        defined as action_function(original_action, context, data_dict)
        where the first parameter will be set to the action function in
        the next plugin or in core ckan. The chained action may call the

class IAuthFunctions(Interface):
    u'''Override CKAN's authorization functions, or add new auth functions.'''

    def get_auth_functions(self):
        u'''Return the authorization functions provided by this plugin.

        Return a dictionary mapping authorization function names (strings) to
        functions. For example::

            {'user_create': my_custom_user_create_function,
             'group_create': my_custom_group_create}

        When a user tries to carry out an action via the CKAN API or web
        interface and CKAN or a CKAN plugin calls
        ``check_access('some_action')`` as a result, an authorization function
        named ``'some_action'`` will be searched for in the authorization
        functions registered by plugins and in CKAN's core authorization
        functions (found in ``ckan/logic/auth/``).

        For example when a user tries to create a package, a
        ``'package_create'`` authorization function is searched for.

        If an extension registers an authorization function with the same name
        as one of CKAN's default authorization functions (as with
        ``'user_create'`` and ``'group_create'`` above), the extension's
        function will override the default one.

        Each authorization function should take two parameters ``context`` and
        ``data_dict``, and should return a dictionary ``{'success': True}`` to
        authorize the action or ``{'success': False}`` to deny it, for
        example::

            def user_create(context, data_dict=None):
                if (some condition):
                    return {'success': True}
                else:
                    return {'success': False, 'msg': 'Not allowed to register'}

        The context object will contain a ``model`` that can be used to query
        the database, a ``user`` containing the name of the user doing the
        request (or their IP if it is an anonymous web request) and an
        ``auth_user_obj`` containing the actual model.User object (or None if
        it is an anonymous request).

        See ``ckan/logic/auth/`` for more examples.

        Note that by default, all auth functions provided by extensions are assumed
        to require a validated user or API key, otherwise a
        :py:class:`ckan.logic.NotAuthorized`: exception will be raised. This check
        will be performed *before* calling the actual auth function. If you want
        to allow anonymous access to one of your actions, its auth function must
        be decorated with the ``auth_allow_anonymous_access`` decorator, available
        on the plugins toolkit.

        For example::

            import ckan.plugins as p

            @p.toolkit.auth_allow_anonymous_access
            def my_search_action(context, data_dict):
                # Note that you can still return {'success': False} if for some
                # reason access is denied.

            def my_create_action(context, data_dict):
                # Unless there is a logged in user or a valid API key provided
                # NotAuthorized will be raised before reaching this function.

        By decorating a registered auth function with the
        'ckan.plugins.toolkit.chained_auth_function` decorator you can create a
        chain of auth checks that are completed when auth is requested. This
        chain starts with the last chained auth function to be registered and
        ends with the original auth function (or a non-chained plugin override
        version). Chained auth functions must accept an extra parameter,
        specifically the next auth function in the chain, for example:

            auth_function(next_auth, context, data_dict).

        The chained auth function may call the next_auth function, optionally
        passing different values, handling exceptions, returning different
        values and/or raising different exceptions to the caller.

     - db_to_form_schema(self)
     - check_data_dict(self, data_dict)

    Furthermore, there can be many implementations of this plugin registered
    at once.  With each instance associating itself with 0 or more group
    type strings.  When a group controller action is invoked, the group
    type determines which of the registered plugins to delegate to.  Each
    implementation must implement two methods which are used to determine the
    group-type -> plugin mapping:

     - is_fallback(self)
     - group_types(self)
     - group_controller(self)

    Implementations might want to consider mixing in
    ckan.lib.plugins.DefaultGroupForm which provides

class IFacets(Interface):
    u'''Customize the search facets shown on search pages.

    By implementing this interface plugins can customize the search facets that
    are displayed for filtering search results on the dataset search page,
    organization pages and group pages.

    The ``facets_dict`` passed to each of the functions below is an
    ``OrderedDict`` in which the keys are CKAN's internal names for the facets
    and the values are the titles that will be shown for the facets in the web
    interface. The order of the keys in the dict determine the order that
    facets appear in on the page.  For example::

        {'groups': _('Groups'),
         'tags': _('Tags'),
         'res_format': _('Formats'),
         'license': _('License')}

    To preserve ordering, make sure to add new facets to the existing dict
    rather than updating it, ie do this::

        facets_dict['groups'] = p.toolkit._('Publisher')
        facets_dict['secondary_publisher'] = p.toolkit._('Secondary Publisher')

    rather than this::

        facets_dict.update({
           'groups': p.toolkit._('Publisher'),
           'secondary_publisher': p.toolkit._('Secondary Publisher'),
        })

    Dataset searches can be faceted on any field in the dataset schema that it
    makes sense to facet on. This means any dataset field that is in CKAN's
    Solr search index, basically any field that you see returned by
    :py:func:`~ckan.logic.action.get.package_show`.

    If there are multiple ``IFacets`` plugins active at once, each plugin will
    be called (in the order that they're listed in the CKAN config file) and
    they will each be able to modify the facets dict in turn.
