        :param title: title of the view type. Will be displayed on the
            frontend. This should be translatable (ie wrapped with
            ``toolkit._('Title')``).
        :param default_title: default title that will be used if the view is
            created automatically (optional, defaults to 'View').
        :param default_description: default description that will be used if
            the view is created automatically (optional, defaults to '').
        :param icon: icon for the view type. Should be one of the
            `Font Awesome`_ types without the `fa fa-` prefix eg. `compass`
            (optional, defaults to 'picture').

            and JavaScript don't clash with the main site theme (optional,
            defaults to True).
        :param preview_enabled: the preview button should appear on the edit
            view form. Some view types have their previews integrated with the
            form (optional, defaults to False).
        :param full_page_edit: the edit form should take the full page width
            of the page (optional, defaults to False).
        :param schema: schema to validate extra configuration fields for the
            view (optional). Schemas are defined as a dictionary, with the
            keys being the field name and the values a list of validator
            functions that will get applied to the field. For instance::

        By decorating a function with ``ckan.plugins.toolkit.chained_action``,
        the action will 'intercept' calls to an existing action function. This
        allows a plugin to modify the behaviour of an existing action function.

        Return a dictionary mapping authorization function names (strings) to
        functions. For example::

            {'user_create': my_custom_user_create_function,
             'group_create': my_custom_group_create}

        When a user tries to carry out an action via the CKAN API or web
        interface and CKAN or a CKAN plugin calls
        ``check_access('some_action')`` as a result, an authorization function
        named ``'some_action'`` will be searched for in the authorization
        functions registered by plugins and in CKAN's core authorization
        functions (found in ``ckan/logic/auth/``).

        For example when action function ``'package_create'`` is called, a
        ``'package_create'`` authorization function is searched for.

        If an extension registers an authorization function with the same name
        as one of CKAN's default authorization functions (as with
        ``'user_create'`` and ``'group_create'`` above), the extension's
        function will override the default one.

        Each authorization function should take two parameters ``context`` and
        ``data_dict``, and should return a dictionary ``{'success': True}`` to
        authorize the action or ``{'success': False}`` to deny it, for
        example::

            def user_create(context, data_dict=None):
                if (some condition):
                    return {'success': True}
                else:
                    return {'success': False, 'msg': 'Not allowed to register'}

        The context object will contain a ``model`` that can be used to query
        the database, a ``user`` containing the name of the user doing the
        request (or their IP if it is an anonymous web request) and an
        ``auth_user_obj`` containing the actual model.User object (or None if
        it is an anonymous request).

        See ``ckan/logic/auth/`` for more examples.

        Note that by default, all auth functions provided by extensions are
        assumed to require a validated user or API key, otherwise a
        :py:class:`ckan.logic.NotAuthorized`: exception will be raised. This
        check will be performed *before* calling the actual auth function. If
        you want to allow anonymous access to one of your actions, its auth
        function must be decorated with the ``auth_allow_anonymous_access``
        decorator, available in the plugins toolkit.

        For example::

            import ckan.plugins as p

            @p.toolkit.auth_allow_anonymous_access
            def my_search_action(context, data_dict):
                # Note that you can still return {'success': False} if for some
                # reason access is denied.

            def my_create_action(context, data_dict):
                # Unless there is a logged in user or a valid API key provided
                # NotAuthorized will be raised before reaching this function.

        By decorating a registered auth function with the
        ``ckan.plugins.toolkit.chained_auth_function`` decorator you can create
        a chain of auth checks that are completed when auth is requested. This
        chain starts with the last chained auth function to be registered and
        ends with the original auth function (or a non-chained plugin override
        version). Chained auth functions must accept an extra parameter,
        specifically the next auth function in the chain, for example::

            auth_function(next_auth, context, data_dict).

        The chained auth function may call the next_auth function, optionally
        passing different values, handling exceptions, returning different
        values and/or raising different exceptions to the caller.

        ``{'example_helper': example_helper}`` allows templates to access the
        ``example_helper`` function via ``h.example_helper()``.

        Function names should start with the name of the extension providing
        the function, to prevent name clashes between extensions.

        By decorating a registered helper function with the
        ``ckan.plugins.toolkit.chained_helper`` decorator you can

        chain starts with the first chained helper to be registered and

        override version). Chained helpers must accept an extra
        parameter, specifically the next helper in the chain, for
        example::

            helper(next_helper, *args, **kwargs).

        The chained helper function may call the next_helper function,

     - db_to_form_schema(self)

    Furthermore, there can be many implementations of this plugin registered
    at once.  With each instance associating itself with 0 or more group
    type strings.  When a group form action is invoked, the group
    type determines which of the registered plugins to delegate to.  Each

    group-type -> plugin mapping:

     - is_fallback(self)
     - group_types(self)
     - group_controller(self)

    Implementations might want to consider mixing in
    ckan.lib.plugins.DefaultGroupForm which provides

class IFacets(Interface):
    u'''Customize the search facets shown on search pages.

    By implementing this interface plugins can customize the search facets that
    are displayed for filtering search results on the dataset search page,
    organization pages and group pages.

    The ``facets_dict`` passed to each of the functions below is an
    ``OrderedDict`` in which the keys are CKAN's internal names for the facets
    and the values are the titles that will be shown for the facets in the web
    interface. The order of the keys in the dict determine the order that
    facets appear in on the page.  For example::

        {'groups': _('Groups'),
         'tags': _('Tags'),
         'res_format': _('Formats'),
         'license': _('License')}

    To preserve ordering, make sure to add new facets to the existing dict
    rather than updating it, ie do this::

        facets_dict['groups'] = p.toolkit._('Publisher')
        facets_dict['secondary_publisher'] = p.toolkit._('Secondary Publisher')

    rather than this::

        facets_dict.update({
           'groups': p.toolkit._('Publisher'),
           'secondary_publisher': p.toolkit._('Secondary Publisher'),
        })

    Dataset searches can be faceted on any field in the dataset schema that it
    makes sense to facet on. This means any dataset field that is in CKAN's
    Solr search index, basically any field that you see returned by
    :py:func:`~ckan.logic.action.get.package_show`.

    If there are multiple ``IFacets`` plugins active at once, each plugin will
    be called (in the order that they're listed in the CKAN config file) and
    they will each be able to modify the facets dict in turn.

class ISignal(Interface):
    """Subscribe to CKAN signals.
    """

    def get_signal_subscriptions(self) -> SignalMapping:
        """Return a mapping of signals to their listeners.

        Note that keys are not strings, they are instances of
        ``blinker.Signal``. When using signals provided by CKAN core,
        it is better to use the references from the :doc:`plugins
        toolkit <plugins-toolkit>` for better future
        compatibility. Values should be a list of listener functions::

            def get_signal_subscriptions(self):
                import ckan.plugins.toolkit as tk

                # or, even better, but requires additional dependency:
                # pip install ckantoolkit
                import ckantoolkit as tk

                return {
                    tk.signals.request_started: [request_listener],
                    tk.signals.register_blueprint: [
                        first_blueprint_listener,
                        second_blueprint_listener
                    ]
                }

        Listeners are callables that accept one mandatory
        argument (``sender``) and an arbitrary number of
        named arguments (text). The best signature for a listener is
        ``def(sender, **kwargs)``.

        The ``sender`` argument  will be different depending on the signal
        and will be generally used to conditionally executing code on the
        listener. For example, the ``register_blueprint`` signal is sent every
        time a custom dataset/group/organization blueprint is registered
        (using :class:`ckan.plugins.interfaces.IDatasetForm`
        or :class:`ckan.plugins.interfaces.IGroupForm`). Depending on
        the kind of blueprint, ``sender`` may be 'dataset', 'group',
        'organization' or 'resource'. If you want to do some work only
        for 'dataset' blueprints, you may end up with something similar to::


            import ckan.plugins.toolkit as tk

            def dataset_blueprint_listener(sender, **kwargs):
                if sender != 'dataset':
                    return
                # Otherwise, do something..

            class ExamplePlugin(plugins.SingletonPlugin)
                plugins.implements(plugins.ISignal)

                def get_signal_subscriptions(self):

                    return {
                        tk.signals.register_blueprint: [
                            dataset_blueprint_listener,
                        ]
                    }

        Because this is a really common use case, there is additional
        form of listener registration supported. Instead of just
        callables, one can use dictionaries of form ``{'receiver':
        CALLABLE, 'sender': DESIRED_SENDER}``. The following code
        snippet has the same effect than the previous one::


            import ckan.plugins.toolkit as tk

            def dataset_blueprint_listener(sender, **kwargs):
                # do something..

            class ExamplePlugin(plugins.SingletonPlugin)
                plugins.implements(plugins.ISignal)

                def get_signal_subscriptions(self):

                    return {
                        tk.signals.register_blueprint: [{
                            'receiver': dataset_blueprint_listener,
                            'sender': 'dataset'
                        }]
                    }

        The two forms of registration can be mixed when multiple
        listeners are registered, callables and dictionaries with
        ``receiver``/``sender`` keys::

            import ckan.plugins.toolkit as tk

            def log_registration(sender, **kwargs):
                log.info("Log something")

            class ExamplePlugin(plugins.SingletonPlugin)
                plugins.implements(plugins.ISignal)

                def get_signal_subscriptions(self):
                    return {
                        tk.signals.request_started: [
                            log_registration,
                            {'receiver': log_registration, 'sender': 'dataset'}
                        ]
                    }

        Even though it is possible to change mutable arguments inside the
        listener, or return something from it, the main purpose of signals
        is the triggering of side effects, like logging, starting background
        jobs, calls to external services, etc.

        Any mutation or attempt to change CKAN behavior through signals should
        be considered unsafe and may lead to hard to track bugs in
        the future. So never modify the arguments of signal listener and
        treat them as constants.

        Always check for the presence of the desired value inside the received
        context (named arguments). Arguments passed to
        signals may change over time, and some arguments may disappear.
