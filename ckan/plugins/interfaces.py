class IAuthFunctions(Interface):
    '''Override CKAN's authorization functions, or add new auth functions.'''

    def get_auth_functions(self):
        '''Return the authorization functions provided by this plugin.

        Return a dictionary mapping authorization function names (strings) to
        functions. For example::

            {'user_create': my_custom_user_create_function,
             'group_create': my_custom_group_create}

        When a user tries to carry out an action via the CKAN API or web
        interface and CKAN or a CKAN plugin calls
        ``check_access('some_action')`` as a result, an authorization function
        named ``'some_action'`` will be searched for in the authorization
        functions registered by plugins and in CKAN's core authorization
        functions (found in ``ckan/logic/auth/``).

        For example when a user tries to create a package, a
        ``'package_create'`` authorization function is searched for.

        If an extension registers an authorization function with the same name
        as one of CKAN's default authorization functions (as with
        ``'user_create'`` and ``'group_create'`` above), the extension's
        function will override the default one.

        Each authorization function should take two parameters ``context`` and
        ``data_dict``, and should return a dictionary ``{'success': True}`` to
        authorize the action or ``{'success': False}`` to deny it, for
        example::

            def user_create(context, data_dict=None):
                if (some condition):
                    return {'success': True}
                else:
                    return {'success': False, 'msg': 'Not allowed to register'}

        The context object will contain a ``model`` that can be used to query
        the database, a ``user`` containing the name of the user doing the
        request (or their IP if it is an anonymous web request) and an
        ``auth_user_obj`` containing the actual model.User object (or None if
        it is an anonymous request).

        See ``ckan/logic/auth/`` for more examples.

        Note that by default, all auth functions provided by extensions are assumed
        to require a validated user or API key, otherwise a
        :py:class:`ckan.logic.NotAuthorized`: exception will be raised. This check
        will be performed *before* calling the actual auth function. If you want
        to allow anonymous access to one of your actions, its auth function must
        be decorated with the ``auth_allow_anonymous_access`` decorator, available
        on the plugins toolkit.

        For example:

            import ckan.plugins as p

            @p.toolkit.auth_allow_anonymous_access
            def my_search_action(context, data_dict):
                # Note that you can still return {'success': False} if for some
                # reason access is denied.

            def my_create_action(context, data_dict):
                # Unless there is a logged in user or a valid API key provided
                # NotAuthorized will be raised before reaching this function.

        '''


class ITemplateHelpers(Interface):
    '''Add custom template helper functions.

    By implementing this plugin interface plugins can provide their own

        ``{'example_helper': example_helper}`` allows templates to access the
        ``example_helper`` function via ``h.example_helper()``.

        Function names should start with the name of the extension providing

    itself with different package types using the ``package_types()`` and
    ``is_fallback()`` methods below, and then providing different schemas and
    templates for different types of dataset.  When a package controller action
    is invoked, the ``type`` field of the package will determine which
    IDatasetForm plugin (if any) gets delegated to.

    When implementing IDatasetForm, you can inherit from
    ``ckan.plugins.toolkit.DefaultDatasetForm``, which provides default

        ``is_fallback()`` method returns ``True``, if this happens CKAN will

        before entering that data into the database.

        If it inherits from ``ckan.plugins.toolkit.DefaultDatasetForm``, a
        plugin can call ``DefaultDatasetForm``'s ``create_package_schema()``
        method to get the default schema and then modify and return it.

        CKAN's ``convert_to_tags()`` or ``convert_to_extras()`` functions can

     - db_to_form_schema(self)
     - check_data_dict(self, data_dict)

    at once.  With each instance associating itself with 0 or more package
    type strings.  When a package controller action is invoked, the package
    type determines which of the registered plugins to delegate to.  Each
    implementation must implement two methods which are used to determine the
    package-type -> plugin mapping:

     - is_fallback(self)
     - package_types(self)

    Implementations might want to consider mixing in
    ckan.lib.plugins.DefaultGroupForm which provides
    default behaviours for the 5 method hooks.
