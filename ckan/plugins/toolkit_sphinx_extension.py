'''A Sphinx extension to automatically document CKAN's crazy plugins toolkit,
autodoc-style.

Sphinx's autodoc extension can document modules or classes, but although it
masquerades as a module CKAN's plugins toolkit is actually neither a module nor
a class, it's an object-instance of a class, and it's an object with weird
__getattr__ behavior too. Autodoc can't handle it, so we have this custom
Sphinx extension to automate documenting it instead.

This extension plugs into the reading phase of the Sphinx build. It intercepts
the 'toolkit' document (extensions/plugins-toolkit.rst) after Sphinx has read
the reStructuredText source from file. It modifies the source, adding in Sphinx
directives for everything in the plugins toolkit, and then the Sphinx build
continues as normal (just as if the generated reStructuredText had been entered
into plugins-toolkit.rst manually before running Sphinx).
