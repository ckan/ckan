'''This is a collection of helper functions for use in tests.

We want to avoid sharing test helper functions between test modules as
much as possible, and we definitely don't want to share test fixtures between
test modules, or to introduce a complex hierarchy of test class subclasses,
etc.

We want to reduce the amount of "travel" that a reader needs to undertake to
understand a test method -- reducing the number of other files they need to go
and read to understand what the test code does. And we want to avoid tightly
coupling test modules to each other by having them share code.

But some test helper functions just increase the readability of tests so much
and make writing tests so much easier, that it's worth having them despite the
potential drawbacks.

This module is reserved for these very useful functions.

    If a test class doesn't use the database (and most test classes shouldn't

def call_action(action_name, context=None, **kwargs):
    '''Call the named ``ckan.logic.action`` function and return the result.

    This is just a nicer way for user code to call action functions, nicer than
    either calling the action function directly or via
    :py:func:`ckan.logic.get_action`.

    For example::

        user_dict = call_action('user_create', name='seanh',
                                email='seanh@seanh.com', password='pass')

    Any keyword arguments given will be wrapped in a dict and passed to the
    action function as its ``data_dict`` argument.

    Note: this skips authorization! It passes 'ignore_auth': True to action
    functions in their ``context`` dicts, so the corresponding authorization
    functions will not be run.
    This is because ckan.tests.logic.action tests only the actions, the
    authorization functions are tested separately in
    ckan.tests.logic.auth.
    See the :doc:`testing guidelines </contributing/testing>` for more info.

    This function should eventually be moved to
    :py:func:`ckan.logic.call_action` and the current
    :py:func:`ckan.logic.get_action` function should be
    deprecated. The tests may still need their own wrapper function for
    :py:func:`ckan.logic.call_action`, e.g. to insert ``'ignore_auth': True``
    into the ``context`` dict.

    :param action_name: the name of the action function to call, e.g.
        ``'user_update'``
    :type action_name: string
    :param context: the context dict to pass to the action function
