class Flag(enum.Flag):
    """Modifiers for :py:class:`~ckan.config.declaration.option.Option`


    ignored: this option is ignored by CKAN(not used or unconditionally
    overriden)

    experimental: this option is not stabilized and can change in
    future. Mainly exist for extension developers, as only stable features are
    included into public CKAN release.

    internal: this option is used internally by CKAN or Flask. Such options are
    not documented and are not supposed to be modified by users. Think about
    them as private class attributes.

    required: this option cannot be missing/empty. Add such flag to the option
    only if CKAN application won't even start without them and there is no
    sensible default.

    editable: this option is runtime editable. Technically, every option can be
    modified. This flag means that there is an expectation that option will be
    modified. For example, this option is exposed via configuration form in the
    Admin UI.

    commented: this option is commented by default in the config file.  Use it
    for optional settings that may break the application when default value is
    used. Example of such option is a cookie domain. When it's missing, the
    current domain is used, so this value is optional. But if you try to
    provide default value, `example.com` or any other domain, CKAN
    authentication will not work as long as application runs on different
    domain. While it's similar to `placeholder` attribute of the
    :py:class:`~ckan.config.declaration.option.Option`, their goals are
    different.
    Option.placeholer:
    - shows an example of expectend value
    - is ignored when config option is **missing** from the config file
    - shown as a default value in the config file generated from template. For
      example, `Option<key=a, placeholder=b, commented=False>` is added to the
      config file as `a = b`. After this, `config.get('a')` returns `b`,
      because it's explicitely written in the config file.
    Flag.commented:
    - Marks option as commented by default
    - Does not changes behavior of `Option.default` and `Option.placeholder`.
    - switches option to the commented state in the config file generated from
      template.  For example, `Option<key=a, placeholder=b, commented=True>` is
      added to the config file as `# a = b`. After this,
      `config.get('a')` returns `None`, because there is no option `a` in
      the config file(it's commented, which makes this option non-existing)
    If the option is missing from the config file, both `placeholder` and
    `commented` are virtually ignored, having absolutely no impact on the value
    of the config option.

    reserved_*(01-10): these flags are added for extension developers. CKAN
    doesn't treat them specially, neither includes them in groups, like
    `not_safe`/`not_iterable`. These flags are completely ignored by CKAN. If
    your extension enchances the behavior of config options using some sort of
    boolean flags - use reserved markers. Always rely on a config option that
    controls, which reserved marker to use, in order to avoid conflicts with
    other extensions. Example:

        >>> # BAD
        >>> marker = Flag.reserved_02
        >>>
        >>> # GOOD
        >>> ### config file
        >>> # my_extension.feature_flag = reserved_02
        >>> key = config.get('my_extension.feature_flag')
        >>> marker = Flag[key]

    This allows the end user to manually solve conflicts, when multiple
    extensions are trying to use the same reserved flag.
