'''
Migrates revisions into the activity stream, to allow you to view old versions
of datasets and changes (diffs) between them.

This should be run once you've upgraded to CKAN 2.9.

This script is not part of the main migrations because it takes a long time to
run, and you don't want it to delay a site going live again after an upgrade.
In the period between upgrading CKAN and this script completes, the Activity
Stream's view of old versions of datasets and diffs between them will be
incomplete - it won't show resources, extras or tags.

This script is idempotent - there is no harm in running this multiple times, or
stopping and restarting it.

We won't delete the revision tables in the database yet, since we haven't
converted the group, package_relationship to activity objects yet.

(In a future version of CKAN we will remove the 'package_revision' table from
the codebase. We'll need a step in the main migration which checks that
migrate_package_activity.py has been done, before it removes the
package_revision table.)

These errors are unusual - maybe a dataset was deleted, purged and then
recreated, or the revisions corrupted for some reason. These activity items now
don't have a package_dict recorded against them, which means that when a user
clicks "View this version" or "Changes" in the Activity Stream for it, it will
be missing. Hopefully that\'s acceptable enough to just ignore, because these
errors are really hard to fix.
