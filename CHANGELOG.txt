v1.8 2012-10-19
===============

Note: This version requires a requirements upgrade on source installations
Note: This version requires a database upgrade
Note: This version does not require a Solr schema upgrade

Major
 * New 'follow' feature that allows logged in users to follow other users or
   datasets (#2304)
 * New user dashboard that shows an activity stream of all the datasets and
   users you are following. Thanks to Sven R. Kunze for his work on this (#2305)
 * New version of the Datastore. It has been completely rewritten to use
   PostgreSQL as backend, it is more stable and fast and supports SQL queries
   (#2733)
 * Clean up and simplifyng of CKAN's dependencies and source install
   instructions. Ubuntu 12.04 is now supported for source installs (#2428,#2592)
 * Big speed improvements when indexing datasets (#2788)
 * New action API reference docs, which individually document each function and
   its arguments and return values (#2345)
 * Updated translations, added Japanese and Korean translations

Minor
 * Add source install upgrade docs (#2757)
 * Mark more strings for translation (#2770)
 * Allow sort ordering of dataset listings on group pages (#2842)
 * Reenable simple search option (#2844)
 * Editing organization removes all datasets (#2845)
 * Accessibility enhancements on templates

Bug fixes
 * Fix for relative url being used when doing file upload to local storage

 * Fix 500 error in related controller (#2856)
 * Fix for non-open licenses appearing open
 * Editing organization removes all datasets (#2845)

API changes and deprecation:
 * Template helper functions are now restricted by default. By default only
   those helper functions listed in lib.helpers.__allowed_functions__
   are available to templates. The full functions can still be made
   available by setting `ckan.restrict_template_vars = false` in your ini file.
   Only restricted functions will be allowed in future versions of CKAN.
 * Deprecated functions related to the old faceting data structure have
   been removed:  `helpers.py:facet_items()`, `facets.html:facet_sidebar()`,
   `facets.html:facet_list_items()`.
   Internal use of the old facets datastructure (attached to the context,
   `c.facets`) has been superseded by use of the improved facet data structure,
   `c.search_facets`.  The old data structure is still available on `c.facets`,
   but is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. (#2313)
