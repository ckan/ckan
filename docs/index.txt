This is the main index page of your documentation. It should be written in
`reStructuredText format <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

You can generate your documentation in HTML format by running this command::

    setup.py pudge

For this to work you will need to download and install ``buildutils`` and
``pudge``.
