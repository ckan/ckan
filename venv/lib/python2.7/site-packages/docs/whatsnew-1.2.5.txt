What's New In FormEncode 1.2.5
==============================

This article explains the latest changes in `FormEncode` version 1.2.5 as
compared to its predecessor, `FormEncode` 1.2.4.

Project Changes
---------------

- New official BitBucket code repository at `formencode/official-formencode
  <http://bitbucket.org/formencode/official-formencode>`_.

Feature Additions
-----------------

- The method `field_is_empty` was added to
  :class:`formencode.validators.FormValidator` so subclasses can use the same
  logic for emptiness and users can override it if necessary.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The view attribute is no longer considered special when scanning Compound
  validators and Schemas for validators.

- The :class:`formencode.validators.RequireIfMissing` and `RequireIfPresent` form
  validators now use the same empty/missing logic as the `is_empty` method of
  :class:`formencode.api.FancyValidator`.

- Validators can say if they accept containers (list, tuple, set, etc) and schema will
  actively refuse those values if a validator does not allow them.

Documentation Enhancements
--------------------------

- Superceded news with whatsnew documents that will be archived for each
  version. Archived all news prior to 1.2.5 in :doc:`/whatsnew-0-to-1.2.4`.
