Things To Do
++++++++++++

:version: |release|
:date: |today|

* Add a parallel to Pipe for the Any compound validator that performs
  validation for each validator to python from left to right.

* Make a test fixture for validators, to make testing really easy.

* Consider moving htmlfill to ElementTree or another DOM-ish
  structure, instead of HTMLParser.  Or re-implement with another
  parser but same interface.

* Generate Javascript for validators, for client-side validation (when
  possible).

* Relatedly, test and give recipes for Ajax-ish validation, when fully
  client-side validation doesn't work.

* Better tests for ``htmlfill`` and ``htmlfill_schemabuilder``.

* Include at least one good documented form generator.  Consider
  including rich widgets (Javascript).

* Seperate out ``doctest_xml_compare``, maybe (useful in any doctested
  web test).

* Make ``doctest_xml_compare`` work with wildcards/ellipses.  Maybe
  with non-XHTML.

* Some more ways to build validation.  Validation from docstrings or
  method signatures.
