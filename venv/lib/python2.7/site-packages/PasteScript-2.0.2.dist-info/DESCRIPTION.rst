PasteScript is a pluggable command-line tool.

It includes some built-in features;

* Create file layouts for packages.  For instance, ``paster create
  --template=basic_package MyPackage`` will create a `setuptools
  <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`_-ready
  file layout.

* Serving up web applications, with configuration based on
  `paste.deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_.

The latest version is available in a `Mercurial repository
<http://bitbucket.org/ianb/pastescript/>`_.
