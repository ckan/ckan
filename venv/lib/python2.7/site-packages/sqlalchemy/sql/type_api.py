    """Allows the creation of types which add additional functionality
    to an existing type.

    This method is preferred to direct subclassing of SQLAlchemy's
    built-in types as it ensures that all required functionality of
    the underlying type is kept in place.

    Typical usage::

      import sqlalchemy.types as types

      class MyType(types.TypeDecorator):
          '''Prefixes Unicode values with "PREFIX:" on the way in and
          strips it off on the way out.
          '''

          impl = types.Unicode

          def process_bind_param(self, value, dialect):
              return "PREFIX:" + value

          def process_result_value(self, value, dialect):
              return value[7:]

          def copy(self, **kw):
              return MyType(self.impl.length)

    The class-level "impl" attribute is required, and can reference any
    TypeEngine class.  Alternatively, the load_dialect_impl() method
    can be used to provide different type classes based on the dialect
    given; in this case, the "impl" variable can reference
    ``TypeEngine`` as a placeholder.

    Types that receive a Python type that isn't similar to the ultimate type
    used may want to define the :meth:`TypeDecorator.coerce_compared_value`
    method. This is used to give the expression system a hint when coercing
    Python objects into bind parameters within expressions. Consider this
    expression::

        mytable.c.somecol + datetime.date(2009, 5, 15)

    Above, if "somecol" is an ``Integer`` variant, it makes sense that
    we're doing date arithmetic, where above is usually interpreted
    by databases as adding a number of days to the given date.
    The expression system does the right thing by not attempting to
    coerce the "date()" value into an integer-oriented bind parameter.

    However, in the case of ``TypeDecorator``, we are usually changing an
    incoming Python type to something new - ``TypeDecorator`` by default will
    "coerce" the non-typed side to be the same type as itself. Such as below,
    we define an "epoch" type that stores a date value as an integer::

        class MyEpochType(types.TypeDecorator):
            impl = types.Integer

            epoch = datetime.date(1970, 1, 1)

            def process_bind_param(self, value, dialect):
                return (value - self.epoch).days

            def process_result_value(self, value, dialect):
                return self.epoch + timedelta(days=value)

    Our expression of ``somecol + date`` with the above type will coerce the
    "date" on the right side to also be treated as ``MyEpochType``.

    This behavior can be overridden via the
    :meth:`~TypeDecorator.coerce_compared_value` method, which returns a type
    that should be used for the value of the expression. Below we set it such
    that an integer value will be treated as an ``Integer``, and any other
    value is assumed to be a date and will be treated as a ``MyEpochType``::

        def coerce_compared_value(self, op, value):
            if isinstance(value, int):
                return Integer()
            else:
                return self

    .. warning::

       Note that the **behavior of coerce_compared_value is not inherited
       by default from that of the base type**.
       If the :class:`.TypeDecorator` is augmenting a
       type that requires special logic for certain types of operators,
       this method **must** be overridden.  A key example is when decorating
       the :class:`.postgresql.JSON` and :class:`.postgresql.JSONB` types;
       the default rules of :meth:`.TypeEngine.coerce_compared_value` should
       be used in order to deal with operators like index operations::

            class MyJsonType(TypeDecorator):
                impl = postgresql.JSON

                def coerce_compared_value(self, op, value):
                    return self.impl.coerce_compared_value(op, value)

       Without the above step, index operations such as ``mycol['foo']``
       will cause the index value ``'foo'`` to be JSON encoded.
