class SessionTransaction(object):
    """A :class:`.Session`-level transaction.

    :class:`.SessionTransaction` is a mostly behind-the-scenes object
    not normally referenced directly by application code.   It coordinates
    among multiple :class:`.Connection` objects, maintaining a database
    transaction for each one individually, committing or rolling them
    back all at once.   It also provides optional two-phase commit behavior
    which can augment this coordination operation.

    The :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute of :class:`.Session`
    refers to the current :class:`.SessionTransaction` object in use, if any.
    The :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` attribute refers to the parent
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` in the stack of :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    objects.  If this attribute is ``None``, then this is the top of the stack.
    If non-``None``, then this :class:`.SessionTransaction` refers either
    to a so-called "subtransaction" or a "nested" transaction.  A
    "subtransaction" is a scoping concept that demarcates an inner portion
    of the outermost "real" transaction.  A nested transaction, which
    is indicated when the :attr:`.SessionTransaction.nested`
    attribute is also True, indicates that this :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    corresponds to a SAVEPOINT.

    **Life Cycle**

    A :class:`.SessionTransaction` is associated with a :class:`.Session`
    in its default mode of ``autocommit=False`` immediately, associated
    with no database connections.  As the :class:`.Session` is called upon
    to emit SQL on behalf of various :class:`.Engine` or :class:`.Connection`
    objects, a corresponding :class:`.Connection` and associated
    :class:`.Transaction` is added to a collection within the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` object, becoming one of the
    connection/transaction pairs maintained by the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction`.  The start of a :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    can be tracked using the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_create`
    event.

    The lifespan of the :class:`.SessionTransaction` ends when the
    :meth:`.Session.commit`, :meth:`.Session.rollback` or
    :meth:`.Session.close` methods are called.  At this point, the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` removes its association with its parent
    :class:`.Session`.   A :class:`.Session` that is in ``autocommit=False``
    mode will create a new :class:`.SessionTransaction` to replace it
    immediately, whereas a :class:`.Session` that's in ``autocommit=True``
    mode will remain without a :class:`.SessionTransaction` until the
    :meth:`.Session.begin` method is called.  The end of a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` can be tracked using the
    :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_end` event.

    **Nesting and Subtransactions**

    Another detail of :class:`.SessionTransaction` behavior is that it is
    capable of "nesting".  This means that the :meth:`.Session.begin` method
    can be called while an existing :class:`.SessionTransaction` is already
    present, producing a new :class:`.SessionTransaction` that temporarily
    replaces the parent :class:`.SessionTransaction`.   When a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` is produced as nested, it assigns itself to
    the :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute, and it additionally will assign
    the previous :class:`.SessionTransaction` to its :attr:`.Session.parent`
    attribute.  The behavior is effectively a
    stack, where :attr:`.Session.transaction` refers to the current head of
    the stack, and the :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` attribute allows
    traversal up the stack until :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` is
    ``None``, indicating the top of the stack.

    When the scope of :class:`.SessionTransaction` is ended via
    :meth:`.Session.commit` or :meth:`.Session.rollback`, it restores its
    parent :class:`.SessionTransaction` back onto the
    :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute.

    The purpose of this stack is to allow nesting of
    :meth:`.Session.rollback` or :meth:`.Session.commit` calls in context
    with various flavors of :meth:`.Session.begin`. This nesting behavior
    applies to when :meth:`.Session.begin_nested` is used to emit a
    SAVEPOINT transaction, and is also used to produce a so-called
    "subtransaction" which allows a block of code to use a
    begin/rollback/commit sequence regardless of whether or not its enclosing
    code block has begun a transaction.  The :meth:`.flush` method, whether
    called explicitly or via autoflush, is the primary consumer of the
    "subtransaction" feature, in that it wishes to guarantee that it works
    within in a transaction block regardless of whether or not the
    :class:`.Session` is in transactional mode when the method is called.

    Note that the flush process that occurs within the "autoflush" feature
    as well as when the :meth:`.Session.flush` method is used **always**
    creates a :class:`.SessionTransaction` object.   This object is normally
    a subtransaction, unless the :class:`.Session` is in autocommit mode
    and no transaction exists at all, in which case it's the outermost
    transaction.   Any event-handling logic or other inspection logic
    needs to take into account whether a :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    is the outermost transaction, a subtransaction, or a "nested" / SAVEPOINT
    transaction.

        See also the :class:`.sessionmaker` function which is used to
        generate a :class:`.Session`-producing callable with a given
        set of arguments.

        :param autocommit:

          .. warning::

             The autocommit flag is **not for general use**, and if it is
             used, queries should only be invoked within the span of a
             :meth:`.Session.begin` / :meth:`.Session.commit` pair.  Executing
             queries outside of a demarcated transaction is a legacy mode
             of usage, and can in some cases lead to concurrent connection
             checkouts.

          Defaults to ``False``. When ``True``, the
          :class:`.Session` does not keep a persistent transaction running,
          and will acquire connections from the engine on an as-needed basis,
          returning them immediately after their use. Flushes will begin and
          commit (or possibly rollback) their own transaction if no
          transaction is present. When using this mode, the
          :meth:`.Session.begin` method is used to explicitly start
          transactions.

          .. seealso::

            :ref:`session_autocommit`

        :param autoflush: When ``True``, all query operations will issue a
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` call to this ``Session`` before proceeding.
           This is a convenience feature so that :meth:`~.Session.flush` need
           not be called repeatedly in order for database queries to retrieve
           results. It's typical that ``autoflush`` is used in conjunction
           with ``autocommit=False``. In this scenario, explicit calls to
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` are rarely needed; you usually only need to
           call :meth:`~.Session.commit` (which flushes) to finalize changes.

        :param bind: An optional :class:`.Engine` or :class:`.Connection` to
           which this ``Session`` should be bound. When specified, all SQL
           operations performed by this session will execute via this
           connectable.

        :param binds: An optional dictionary which contains more granular
           "bind" information than the ``bind`` parameter provides. This
           dictionary can map individual :class`.Table`
           instances as well as :class:`~.Mapper` instances to individual
           :class:`.Engine` or :class:`.Connection` objects. Operations which
           proceed relative to a particular :class:`.Mapper` will consult this
           dictionary for the direct :class:`.Mapper` instance as
           well as the mapper's ``mapped_table`` attribute in order to locate
           a connectable to use. The full resolution is described in the
           :meth:`.Session.get_bind`.
           Usage looks like::

            Session = sessionmaker(binds={
                SomeMappedClass: create_engine('postgresql://engine1'),
                somemapper: create_engine('postgresql://engine2'),
                some_table: create_engine('postgresql://engine3'),
                })

          Also see the :meth:`.Session.bind_mapper`
          and :meth:`.Session.bind_table` methods.

        :param \class_: Specify an alternate class other than
           ``sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session`` which should be used by the
           returned class. This is the only argument that is local to the
           :class:`.sessionmaker` function, and is not sent directly to the
           constructor for ``Session``.

        :param _enable_transaction_accounting:  Defaults to ``True``.  A
           legacy-only flag which when ``False`` disables *all* 0.5-style
           object accounting on transaction boundaries, including auto-expiry
           of instances on rollback and commit, maintenance of the "new" and
           "deleted" lists upon rollback, and autoflush of pending changes
           upon :meth:`~.Session.begin`, all of which are interdependent.

        :param expire_on_commit:  Defaults to ``True``. When ``True``, all
           instances will be fully expired after each :meth:`~.commit`,
           so that all attribute/object access subsequent to a completed
           transaction will load from the most recent database state.

        :param extension: An optional
           :class:`~.SessionExtension` instance, or a list
           of such instances, which will receive pre- and post- commit and
           flush events, as well as a post-rollback event. **Deprecated.**
           Please see :class:`.SessionEvents`.

        :param info: optional dictionary of arbitrary data to be associated
           with this :class:`.Session`.  Is available via the
           :attr:`.Session.info` attribute.  Note the dictionary is copied at
           construction time so that modifications to the per-
           :class:`.Session` dictionary will be local to that
           :class:`.Session`.

           .. versionadded:: 0.9.0

        :param query_cls:  Class which should be used to create new Query
          objects, as returned by the :meth:`~.Session.query` method.
          Defaults to :class:`.Query`.

        :param twophase:  When ``True``, all transactions will be started as
            a "two phase" transaction, i.e. using the "two phase" semantics
            of the database in use along with an XID.  During a
            :meth:`~.commit`, after :meth:`~.flush` has been issued for all
            attached databases, the :meth:`~.TwoPhaseTransaction.prepare`
            method on each database's :class:`.TwoPhaseTransaction` will be
            called. This allows each database to roll back the entire
            transaction, before each transaction is committed.

        :param weak_identity_map:  Defaults to ``True`` - when set to
           ``False``, objects placed in the :class:`.Session` will be
           strongly referenced until explicitly removed or the
           :class:`.Session` is closed.  **Deprecated** - The strong
           reference identity map is legacy.  See the

        :class:`.Connection`.

        E.g.::

            result = session.execute(
                        user_table.select().where(user_table.c.id == 5)
                    )

        :meth:`~.Session.execute` accepts any executable clause construct,
        such as :func:`~.sql.expression.select`,
        :func:`~.sql.expression.insert`,
        :func:`~.sql.expression.update`,
        :func:`~.sql.expression.delete`, and
        :func:`~.sql.expression.text`.  Plain SQL strings can be passed
        as well, which in the case of :meth:`.Session.execute` only
        will be interpreted the same as if it were passed via a
        :func:`~.expression.text` construct.  That is, the following usage::

            result = session.execute(
                        "SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=:param",
                        {"param":5}
                    )

        is equivalent to::

            from sqlalchemy import text
            result = session.execute(
                        text("SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=:param"),
                        {"param":5}
                    )

        The second positional argument to :meth:`.Session.execute` is an
        optional parameter set.  Similar to that of
        :meth:`.Connection.execute`, whether this is passed as a single
        dictionary, or a list of dictionaries, determines whether the DBAPI
        cursor's ``execute()`` or ``executemany()`` is used to execute the
        statement.   An INSERT construct may be invoked for a single row::

            result = session.execute(
                users.insert(), {"id": 7, "name": "somename"})

        or for multiple rows::

            result = session.execute(users.insert(), [
                                    {"id": 7, "name": "somename7"},
                                    {"id": 8, "name": "somename8"},
                                    {"id": 9, "name": "somename9"}
                                ])

        The statement is executed within the current transactional context of
        this :class:`.Session`.   The :class:`.Connection` which is used
        to execute the statement can also be acquired directly by
        calling the :meth:`.Session.connection` method.  Both methods use
        a rule-based resolution scheme in order to determine the
        :class:`.Connection`, which in the average case is derived directly
        from the "bind" of the :class:`.Session` itself, and in other cases
        can be based on the :func:`.mapper`
        and :class:`.Table` objects passed to the method; see the
        documentation for :meth:`.Session.get_bind` for a full description of
        this scheme.

        The :meth:`.Session.execute` method does *not* invoke autoflush.

        The :class:`.ResultProxy` returned by the :meth:`.Session.execute`
        method is returned with the "close_with_result" flag set to true;
        the significance of this flag is that if this :class:`.Session` is
        autocommitting and does not have a transaction-dedicated
        :class:`.Connection` available, a temporary :class:`.Connection` is
        established for the statement execution, which is closed (meaning,
        returned to the connection pool) when the :class:`.ResultProxy` has
        consumed all available data. This applies *only* when the
        :class:`.Session` is configured with autocommit=True and no
        transaction has been started.

        :param clause:
            An executable statement (i.e. an :class:`.Executable` expression
            such as :func:`.expression.select`) or string SQL statement
            to be executed.

        :param params:
            Optional dictionary, or list of dictionaries, containing
            bound parameter values.   If a single dictionary, single-row
            execution occurs; if a list of dictionaries, an
            "executemany" will be invoked.  The keys in each dictionary
            must correspond to parameter names present in the statement.

        :param mapper:
          Optional :func:`.mapper` or mapped class, used to identify
          the appropriate bind.  This argument takes precedence over
          ``clause`` when locating a bind.   See :meth:`.Session.get_bind`
          for more details.

        :param bind:
          Optional :class:`.Engine` to be used as the bind.  If
          this engine is already involved in an ongoing transaction,
          that connection will be used.  This argument takes
          precedence over ``mapper`` and ``clause`` when locating
          a bind.

        :param \**kw:
          Additional keyword arguments are sent to :meth:`.Session.get_bind()`
          to allow extensibility of "bind" schemes.

        in database state outside of that transaction.

        To expire all objects in the :class:`.Session` simultaneously,
        use :meth:`Session.expire_all`.

        The :class:`.Session` object's default behavior is to
        expire all state whenever the :meth:`Session.rollback`
        or :meth:`Session.commit` methods are called, so that new
        state can be loaded for the new transaction.   For this reason,
        calling :meth:`Session.expire` only makes sense for the specific
        case that a non-ORM SQL statement was emitted in the current
        transaction.

        :param instance: The instance to be refreshed.
        :param attribute_names: optional list of string attribute names
          indicating a subset of attributes to be expired.

        same primary key in the session.   If not found locally, it attempts
        to load the object from the database based on primary key, and if
        none can be located, creates a new instance.  The state of each
        attribute on the source instance is then copied to the target
        instance.  The resulting target instance is then returned by the
        method; the original source instance is left unmodified, and
        un-associated with the :class:`.Session` if not already.

        This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is
        mapped with ``cascade="merge"``.

        See :ref:`unitofwork_merging` for a detailed discussion of merging.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1 - :meth:`.Session.merge` will now reconcile
           pending objects with overlapping primary keys in the same way
           as persistent.  See :ref:`change_3601` for discussion.

        :param instance: Instance to be merged.
        :param load: Boolean, when False, :meth:`.merge` switches into
         a "high performance" mode which causes it to forego emitting history
         events as well as all database access.  This flag is used for
         cases such as transferring graphs of objects into a :class:`.Session`
         from a second level cache, or to transfer just-loaded objects
         into the :class:`.Session` owned by a worker thread or process
         without re-querying the database.

         The ``load=False`` use case adds the caveat that the given
         object has to be in a "clean" state, that is, has no pending changes
         to be flushed - even if the incoming object is detached from any
         :class:`.Session`.   This is so that when
         the merge operation populates local attributes and
         cascades to related objects and
         collections, the values can be "stamped" onto the
         target object as is, without generating any history or attribute
         events, and without the need to reconcile the incoming data with
         any existing related objects or collections that might not
         be loaded.  The resulting objects from ``load=False`` are always
         produced as "clean", so it is only appropriate that the given objects
         should be "clean" as well, else this suggests a mis-use of the
         method.

            :meth:`.enable_relationship_loading` exists to serve special
            use cases and is not recommended for general use.

        Accesses of attributes mapped with :func:`.relationship`
        will attempt to load a value from the database using this
        :class:`.Session` as the source of connectivity.  The values
        will be loaded based on foreign key values present on this
        object - it follows that this functionality
        generally only works for many-to-one-relationships.

        The object will be attached to this session, but will
        **not** participate in any persistence operations; its state
        for almost all purposes will remain either "transient" or
        "detached", except for the case of relationship loading.

        Also note that backrefs will often not work as expected.
        Altering a relationship-bound attribute on the target object
        may not fire off a backref event, if the effective value
        is what was already loaded from a foreign-key-holding value.

        The :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` method is
        similar to the ``load_on_pending`` flag on :func:`.relationship`.
        Unlike that flag, :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` allows
        an object to remain transient while still being able to load
        related items.

        To make a transient object associated with a :class:`.Session`
        via :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` pending, add
        it to the :class:`.Session` using :meth:`.Session.add` normally.

        :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` does not improve
        behavior when the ORM is used normally - object references should be
        constructed at the object level, not at the foreign key level, so
        that they are present in an ordinary way before flush()
        proceeds.  This method is not intended for general use.

         each column-set that contains a different combination of NULL values
         than the previous row must omit a different series of columns from
         the rendered INSERT statement, which means it must be emitted as a
         separate statement.   By passing this flag, the full set of rows
         are guaranteed to be batchable into one batch; the cost however is
         that server-side defaults which are invoked by an omitted column will
         be skipped, so care must be taken to ensure that these are not
         necessary.

        This method retrieves the history for each instrumented
        attribute on the instance and performs a comparison of the current
        value to its previously committed value, if any.

        It is in effect a more expensive and accurate
        version of checking for the given instance in the
        :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection; a full test for
        each attribute's net "dirty" status is performed.

        E.g.::

            return session.is_modified(someobject)

        .. versionchanged:: 0.8
            When using SQLAlchemy 0.7 and earlier, the ``passive``
            flag should **always** be explicitly set to ``True``,
            else SQL loads/autoflushes may proceed which can affect
            the modified state itself:
            ``session.is_modified(someobject, passive=True)``\ .
            In 0.8 and above, the behavior is corrected and
            this flag is ignored.

        A few caveats to this method apply:

        * Instances present in the :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection may
          report ``False`` when tested with this method.  This is because
          the object may have received change events via attribute mutation,
          thus placing it in :attr:`.Session.dirty`, but ultimately the state
          is the same as that loaded from the database, resulting in no net
          change here.
        * Scalar attributes may not have recorded the previously set
          value when a new value was applied, if the attribute was not loaded,
          or was expired, at the time the new value was received - in these
          cases, the attribute is assumed to have a change, even if there is
          ultimately no net change against its database value. SQLAlchemy in
          most cases does not need the "old" value when a set event occurs, so
          it skips the expense of a SQL call if the old value isn't present,
          based on the assumption that an UPDATE of the scalar value is
          usually needed, and in those few cases where it isn't, is less
          expensive on average than issuing a defensive SELECT.

          The "old" value is fetched unconditionally upon set only if the
          attribute container has the ``active_history`` flag set to ``True``.
          This flag is set typically for primary key attributes and scalar
          object references that are not a simple many-to-one.  To set this
          flag for any arbitrary mapped column, use the ``active_history``
          argument with :func:`.column_property`.

        :param instance: mapped instance to be tested for pending changes.
        :param include_collections: Indicates if multivalued collections
         should be included in the operation.  Setting this to ``False`` is a
         way to detect only local-column based properties (i.e. scalar columns
         or many-to-one foreign keys) that would result in an UPDATE for this
         instance upon flush.

         .. versionchanged:: 0.8

        """True if this :class:`.Session` is in "transaction mode" and
        is not in "partial rollback" state.

        The :class:`.Session` in its default mode of ``autocommit=False``
        is essentially always in "transaction mode", in that a
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` is associated with it as soon as
        it is instantiated.  This :class:`.SessionTransaction` is immediately
        replaced with a new one as soon as it is ended, due to a rollback,
        commit, or close operation.

        "Transaction mode" does *not* indicate whether
        or not actual database connection resources are in use;  the
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` object coordinates among zero or more
        actual database transactions, and starts out with none, accumulating
        individual DBAPI connections as different data sources are used
        within its scope.   The best way to track when a particular
        :class:`.Session` has actually begun to use DBAPI resources is to
        implement a listener using the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_begin`
        method, which will deliver both the :class:`.Session` as well as the
        target :class:`.Connection` to a user-defined event listener.

        The "partial rollback" state refers to when an "inner" transaction,
        typically used during a flush, encounters an error and emits a
        rollback of the DBAPI connection.  At this point, the
        :class:`.Session` is in "partial rollback" and awaits for the user to
        call :meth:`.Session.rollback`, in order to close out the
        transaction stack.  It is in this "partial rollback" period that the
        :attr:`.is_active` flag returns False.  After the call to
        :meth:`.Session.rollback`, the :class:`.SessionTransaction` is
        replaced with a new one and :attr:`.is_active` returns ``True`` again.

        When a :class:`.Session` is used in ``autocommit=True`` mode, the
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` is only instantiated within the scope
        of a flush call, or when :meth:`.Session.begin` is called.  So
        :attr:`.is_active` will always be ``False`` outside of a flush or
        :meth:`.Session.begin` block in this mode, and will be ``True``
        within the :meth:`.Session.begin` block as long as it doesn't enter
        "partial rollback" state.

        From all the above, it follows that the only purpose to this flag is
        for application frameworks that wish to detect is a "rollback" is
        necessary within a generic error handling routine, for
        :class:`.Session` objects that would otherwise be in
        "partial rollback" mode.  In a typical integration case, this is also
        not necessary as it is standard practice to emit
        :meth:`.Session.rollback` unconditionally within the outermost
        exception catch.

        To track the transactional state of a :class:`.Session` fully,
        use event listeners, primarily the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_begin`,
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_commit`,
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_rollback` and related events.
