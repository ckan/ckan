@util.langhelpers.dependency_for("sqlalchemy.orm.interfaces")
class MapperExtension(object):
    """Base implementation for :class:`.Mapper` event hooks.

    .. note::

       :class:`.MapperExtension` is deprecated.   Please
       refer to :func:`.event.listen` as well as
       :class:`.MapperEvents`.

    New extension classes subclass :class:`.MapperExtension` and are specified
    using the ``extension`` mapper() argument, which is a single
    :class:`.MapperExtension` or a list of such::

        from sqlalchemy.orm.interfaces import MapperExtension

        class MyExtension(MapperExtension):
            def before_insert(self, mapper, connection, instance):
                print "instance %s before insert !" % instance

        m = mapper(User, users_table, extension=MyExtension())

    A single mapper can maintain a chain of ``MapperExtension``
    objects. When a particular mapping event occurs, the
    corresponding method on each ``MapperExtension`` is invoked
    serially, and each method has the ability to halt the chain
    from proceeding further::

        m = mapper(User, users_table, extension=[ext1, ext2, ext3])

    Each ``MapperExtension`` method returns the symbol
    EXT_CONTINUE by default.   This symbol generally means "move
    to the next ``MapperExtension`` for processing".  For methods
    that return objects like translated rows or new object
    instances, EXT_CONTINUE means the result of the method
    should be ignored.   In some cases it's required for a
    default mapper activity to be performed, such as adding a
    new instance to a result list.

    The symbol EXT_STOP has significance within a chain
    of ``MapperExtension`` objects that the chain will be stopped
    when this symbol is returned.  Like EXT_CONTINUE, it also
    has additional significance in some cases that a default
    mapper activity will not be performed.
