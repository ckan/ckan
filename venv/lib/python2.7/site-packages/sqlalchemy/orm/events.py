class InstrumentationEvents(event.Events):
    """Events related to class instrumentation events.

    The listeners here support being established against
    any new style class, that is any object that is a subclass
    of 'type'.  Events will then be fired off for events
    against that class.  If the "propagate=True" flag is passed
    to event.listen(), the event will fire off for subclasses
    of that class as well.

    The Python ``type`` builtin is also accepted as a target,
    which when used has the effect of events being emitted
    for all classes.

    Note the "propagate" flag here is defaulted to ``True``,
    unlike the other class level events where it defaults
    to ``False``.  This means that new subclasses will also
    be the subject of these events, when a listener
    is established on a superclass.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.8 - events here will emit based
       on comparing the incoming class to the type of class
       passed to :func:`.event.listen`.  Previously, the
       event would fire for any class unconditionally regardless
       of what class was sent for listening, despite
       documentation which stated the contrary.

        within the scope of the :func:`.configure_mappers` call.

        The :meth:`.MapperEvents.mapper_configured` event is invoked
        for each mapper that is encountered when the
        :func:`.orm.configure_mappers` function proceeds through the current
        list of not-yet-configured mappers.
        :func:`.orm.configure_mappers` is typically invoked
        automatically as mappings are first used, as well as each time
        new mappers have been made available and new mapper use is
        detected.

        When the event is called, the mapper should be in its final
        state, but **not including backrefs** that may be invoked from
        other mappers; they might still be pending within the
        configuration operation.    Bidirectional relationships that
        are instead configured via the
        :paramref:`.orm.relationship.back_populates` argument
        *will* be fully available, since this style of relationship does not
        rely upon other possibly-not-configured mappers to know that they
        exist.

        For an event that is guaranteed to have **all** mappers ready
        to go including backrefs that are defined only on other
        mappings, use the :meth:`.MapperEvents.after_configured`
        event; this event invokes only after all known mappings have been
        fully configured.

        The :meth:`.MapperEvents.mapper_configured` event, unlike
        :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_configured` or
        :meth:`.MapperEvents.after_configured`,
        is called for each mapper/class individually, and the mapper is
        passed to the event itself.  It also is called exactly once for
        a particular mapper.  The event is therefore useful for
        configurational steps that benefit from being invoked just once
        on a specific mapper basis, which don't require that "backref"
        configurations are necessarily ready yet.

        :param mapper: the :class:`.Mapper` which is the target

    def init_scalar(self, target, value, dict_):
        """Receive a scalar "init" event.

        This event is invoked when an uninitialized, unpersisted scalar
        attribute is accessed.  A value of ``None`` is typically returned
        in this case; no changes are made to the object's state.

        The event handler can alter this behavior in two ways.
        One is that a value other than ``None`` may be returned.  The other
        is that the value may be established as part of the object's state,
        which will also have the effect that it is persisted.

        Typical use is to establish a specific default value of an attribute
        upon access::

            SOME_CONSTANT = 3.1415926

            @event.listens_for(
                MyClass.some_attribute, "init_scalar",

            def _init_some_attribute(target, dict_, value):
                dict_['some_attribute'] = SOME_CONSTANT
                return SOME_CONSTANT

        Above, we initialize the attribute ``MyClass.some_attribute`` to the
        value of ``SOME_CONSTANT``.   The above code includes the following
        features:

        * By setting the value ``SOME_CONSTANT`` in the given ``dict_``,
          we indicate that the value is to be persisted to the database.
          **The given value is only persisted to the database if we
          explicitly associate it with the object**.  The ``dict_`` given
          is the ``__dict__`` element of the mapped object, assuming the
          default attribute instrumentation system is in place.

        * By establishing the ``retval=True`` flag, the value we return
          from the function will be returned by the attribute getter.
          Without this flag, the event is assumed to be a passive observer
          and the return value of our function is ignored.

        * The ``propagate=True`` flag is significant if the mapped class
          includes inheriting subclasses, which would also make use of this
          event listener.  Without this flag, an inheriting subclass will
          not use our event handler.

        When we establish the value in the given dictionary, the value will
        be used in the INSERT statement established by the unit of work.
        Normally, the default returned value of ``None`` is not established as
        part of the object, to avoid the issue of mutations occurring to the
        object in response to a normally passive "get" operation, and also
        sidesteps the issue of whether or not the :meth:`.AttributeEvents.set`
        event should be awkwardly fired off during an attribute access
        operation.  This does not impact the INSERT operation since the
        ``None`` value matches the value of ``NULL`` that goes into the
        database in any case; note that ``None`` is skipped during the INSERT
        to ensure that column and SQL-level default functions can fire off.

        The attribute set event :meth:`.AttributeEvents.set` as well as the
        related validation feature provided by :obj:`.orm.validates` is
        **not** invoked when we apply our value to the given ``dict_``.  To
        have these events to invoke in response to our newly generated
        value, apply the value to the given object as a normal attribute
        set operation::

            SOME_CONSTANT = 3.1415926

            @event.listens_for(
                MyClass.some_attribute, "init_scalar",
                retval=True, propagate=True)
            def _init_some_attribute(target, dict_, value):
                # will also fire off attribute set events
                target.some_attribute = SOME_CONSTANT
                return SOME_CONSTANT

        When multiple listeners are set up, the generation of the value
        is "chained" from one listener to the next by passing the value
        returned by the previous listener that specifies ``retval=True``
        as the ``value`` argument of the next listener.

        The :meth:`.AttributeEvents.init_scalar` event may be used to
        extract values from the default values and/or callables established on
        mapped :class:`.Column` objects.  See the "active column defaults"
        example in :ref:`examples_instrumentation` for an example of this.

         listener were invoked.  This value begins as the value ``None``,
