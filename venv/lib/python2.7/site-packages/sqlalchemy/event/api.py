            const.name = "uq_%s_%s" % (

    A given function can also be invoked for only the first invocation
    of the event using the ``once`` argument::

        def on_config():
            do_config()

        event.listen(Mapper, "before_configure", on_config, once=True)

    .. versionadded:: 0.9.4 Added ``once=True`` to :func:`.event.listen`
       and :func:`.event.listens_for`.

    .. note::

        The :func:`.listen` function cannot be called at the same time
        that the target event is being run.   This has implications
        for thread safety, and also means an event cannot be added
        from inside the listener function for itself.  The list of
        events to be run are present inside of a mutable collection
        that can't be changed during iteration.

        Event registration and removal is not intended to be a "high
        velocity" operation; it is a configurational operation.  For
        systems that need to quickly associate and deassociate with
        events at high scale, use a mutable structure that is handled
        from inside of a single listener.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0 - a ``collections.deque()`` object is now
           used as the container for the list of events, which explicitly
           disallows collection mutation while the collection is being
           iterated.

    The arguments here should match exactly those which were sent to
    :func:`.listen`; all the event registration which proceeded as a result
    of this call will be reverted by calling :func:`.remove` with the same
    arguments.

    e.g.::

        # if a function was registered like this...
        @event.listens_for(SomeMappedClass, "before_insert", propagate=True)

    propagated to subclasses of ``SomeMappedClass``; the :func:`.remove`
    function will revert all of these operations.
