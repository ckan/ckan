from . import event, exc

from .sql.base import SchemaEventTarget


class DDLEvents(event.Events):
    """
    Define event listeners for schema objects,
    that is, :class:`.SchemaItem` and other :class:`.SchemaEventTarget`
    subclasses, including :class:`.MetaData`, :class:`.Table`,
    :class:`.Column`.

    :class:`.MetaData` and :class:`.Table` support events
    specifically regarding when CREATE and DROP
    DDL is emitted to the database.

    Attachment events are also provided to customize
    behavior whenever a child schema element is associated
    with a parent, such as, when a :class:`.Column` is associated
    with its :class:`.Table`, when a :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`
    is associated with a :class:`.Table`, etc.

    Example using the ``after_create`` event::

        from sqlalchemy import event
        from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Metadata, Integer

        m = MetaData()
        some_table = Table('some_table', m, Column('data', Integer))

        def after_create(target, connection, **kw):
            connection.execute("ALTER TABLE %s SET name=foo_%s" %
                                    (target.name, target.name))

        event.listen(some_table, "after_create", after_create)

    DDL events integrate closely with the
    :class:`.DDL` class and the :class:`.DDLElement` hierarchy
    of DDL clause constructs, which are themselves appropriate
    as listener callables::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL
        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s")
        )

    The methods here define the name of an event as well
    as the names of members that are passed to listener
    functions.

    An event listener can be associated with any :class:`.Connectable`
    class or instance, such as an :class:`.Engine`, e.g.::

        from sqlalchemy import event, create_engine

        def before_cursor_execute(conn, cursor, statement, parameters, context,

    When the methods are called with a `statement` parameter, such as in
    :meth:`.after_cursor_execute`, :meth:`.before_cursor_execute` and
    :meth:`.dbapi_error`, the statement is the exact SQL string that was
    prepared for transmission to the DBAPI ``cursor`` in the connection's
    :class:`.Dialect`.

    The :meth:`.before_execute` and :meth:`.before_cursor_execute`
    events can also be established with the ``retval=True`` flag, which
    allows modification of the statement and parameters to be sent
    to the database.  The :meth:`.before_cursor_execute` event is
    particularly useful here to add ad-hoc string transformations, such
    as comments, to all executions::

        from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine
        from sqlalchemy import event

        @event.listens_for(Engine, "before_cursor_execute", retval=True)

            statement = statement + " -- some comment"
            return statement, parameters

    .. note:: :class:`.ConnectionEvents` can be established on any
       combination of :class:`.Engine`, :class:`.Connection`, as well
       as instances of each of those classes.  Events across all
       four scopes will fire off for a given instance of
       :class:`.Connection`.  However, for performance reasons, the
       :class:`.Connection` object determines at instantiation time
       whether or not its parent :class:`.Engine` has event listeners
       established.   Event listeners added to the :class:`.Engine`
       class or to an instance of :class:`.Engine` *after* the instantiation
       of a dependent :class:`.Connection` instance will usually
       *not* be available on that :class:`.Connection` instance.  The newly
       added listeners will instead take effect for :class:`.Connection`
       instances created subsequent to those event listeners being
       established on the parent :class:`.Engine` class or instance.

        Subsequent to this hook, SQLAlchemy may attempt any
        number of operations on the connection/cursor, including
        closing the cursor, rolling back of the transaction in the
        case of connectionless execution, and disposing of the entire

        This includes all exceptions emitted by the DBAPI as well as
        within SQLAlchemy's statement invocation process, including
        encoding errors and other statement validation errors.  Other areas
        in which the event is invoked include transaction begin and end,
        result row fetching, cursor creation.

        Note that :meth:`.handle_error` may support new kinds of exceptions
        and new calling scenarios at *any time*.  Code which uses this
        event must expect new calling patterns to be present in minor
        releases.

        To support the wide variety of members that correspond to an exception,
        as well as to allow extensibility of the event without backwards
        incompatibility, the sole argument received is an instance of
        :class:`.ExceptionContext`.   This object contains data members
        representing detail about the exception.

        Use cases supported by this hook include:

        * read-only, low-level exception handling for logging and
          debugging purposes
        * exception re-writing
        * Establishing or disabling whether a connection or the owning
          connection pool is invalidated or expired in response to a
          specific exception.

        The hook is called while the cursor from the failed operation
        (if any) is still open and accessible.   Special cleanup operations
        can be called on this cursor; SQLAlchemy will attempt to close
        this cursor subsequent to this hook being invoked.  If the connection
        is in "autocommit" mode, the transaction also remains open within
        the scope of this hook; the rollback of the per-statement transaction
        also occurs after the hook is called.

        The user-defined event handler has two options for replacing
        the SQLAlchemy-constructed exception into one that is user
        defined.   It can either raise this new exception directly, in
        which case all further event listeners are bypassed and the
        exception will be raised, after appropriate cleanup as taken
        place::

            @event.listens_for(Engine, "handle_error")
            def handle_exception(context):
                if isinstance(context.original_exception,
                    psycopg2.OperationalError) and \
                    "failed" in str(context.original_exception):
                    raise MySpecialException("failed operation")

        .. warning::  Because the :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.handle_error`
           event specifically provides for exceptions to be re-thrown as
           the ultimate exception raised by the failed statement,
           **stack traces will be misleading** if the user-defined event
           handler itself fails and throws an unexpected exception;
           the stack trace may not illustrate the actual code line that
           failed!  It is advised to code carefully here and use
           logging and/or inline debugging if unexpected exceptions are
           occurring.

        Alternatively, a "chained" style of event handling can be
        used, by configuring the handler with the ``retval=True``
        modifier and returning the new exception instance from the
        function.  In this case, event handling will continue onto the
        next handler.   The "chained" exception is available using
        :attr:`.ExceptionContext.chained_exception`::

            @event.listens_for(Engine, "handle_error", retval=True)
            def handle_exception(context):
                if context.chained_exception is not None and \
                    "special" in context.chained_exception.message:
                    return MySpecialException("failed",
                        cause=context.chained_exception)

        Handlers that return ``None`` may remain within this chain; the
        last non-``None`` return value is the one that continues to be
        passed to the next handler.

        When a custom exception is raised or returned, SQLAlchemy raises
        this new exception as-is, it is not wrapped by any SQLAlchemy
        object.  If the exception is not a subclass of
        :class:`sqlalchemy.exc.StatementError`,
        certain features may not be available; currently this includes
        the ORM's feature of adding a detail hint about "autoflush" to
        exceptions raised within the autoflush process.

        :param context: an :class:`.ExceptionContext` object.  See this
         class for details on all available members.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9.7 Added the
            :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.handle_error` hook.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1 The :meth:`.handle_error` event will now
           receive all exceptions that inherit from ``BaseException``, including
           ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt``.  The setting for
           :attr:`.ExceptionContext.is_disconnect` is ``True`` in this case
           and the default for :attr:`.ExceptionContext.invalidate_pool_on_disconnect`
           is ``False``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0 The :meth:`.handle_error` event is now
           invoked when an :class:`.Engine` fails during the initial
           call to :meth:`.Engine.connect`, as well as when a
           :class:`.Connection` object encounters an error during a
           reconnect operation.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0 The :meth:`.handle_error` event is
           not fired off when a dialect makes use of the
           ``skip_user_error_events`` execution option.   This is used
           by dialects which intend to catch SQLAlchemy-specific exceptions
           within specific operations, such as when the MySQL dialect detects
           a table not present within the ``has_table()`` dialect method.
           Prior to 1.0.0, code which implements :meth:`.handle_error` needs
           to ensure that exceptions thrown in these scenarios are re-raised
           without modification.
