class Dialect(object):
    """Define the behavior of a specific database and DB-API combination.

    Any aspect of metadata definition, SQL query generation,
    execution, result-set handling, or anything else which varies
    between databases is defined under the general category of the
    Dialect.  The Dialect acts as a factory for other
    database-specific object implementations including
    ExecutionContext, Compiled, DefaultGenerator, and TypeEngine.

    All Dialects implement the following attributes:

    name
      identifying name for the dialect from a DBAPI-neutral point of view
      (i.e. 'sqlite')

    driver
      identifying name for the dialect's DBAPI

    positional
      True if the paramstyle for this Dialect is positional.

    paramstyle
      the paramstyle to be used (some DB-APIs support multiple
      paramstyles).

    convert_unicode
      True if Unicode conversion should be applied to all ``str``
      types.

    encoding
      type of encoding to use for unicode, usually defaults to
      'utf-8'.

    statement_compiler
      a :class:`.Compiled` class used to compile SQL statements

    ddl_compiler
      a :class:`.Compiled` class used to compile DDL statements

    server_version_info
      a tuple containing a version number for the DB backend in use.
      This value is only available for supporting dialects, and is
      typically populated during the initial connection to the database.

    default_schema_name
     the name of the default schema.  This value is only available for
     supporting dialects, and is typically populated during the
     initial connection to the database.

    execution_ctx_cls
      a :class:`.ExecutionContext` class used to handle statement execution

    execute_sequence_format
      either the 'tuple' or 'list' type, depending on what cursor.execute()
      accepts for the second argument (they vary).

    preparer
      a :class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.compiler.IdentifierPreparer` class used to
      quote identifiers.

    supports_alter
      ``True`` if the database supports ``ALTER TABLE``.

    max_identifier_length
      The maximum length of identifier names.

    supports_unicode_statements
      Indicate whether the DB-API can receive SQL statements as Python
      unicode strings

    supports_unicode_binds
      Indicate whether the DB-API can receive string bind parameters
      as Python unicode strings

    supports_sane_rowcount
      Indicate whether the dialect properly implements rowcount for
      ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` statements.

    supports_sane_multi_rowcount
      Indicate whether the dialect properly implements rowcount for
      ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` statements when executed via
      executemany.

    preexecute_autoincrement_sequences
      True if 'implicit' primary key functions must be executed separately
      in order to get their value.   This is currently oriented towards
      PostgreSQL.

    implicit_returning
      use RETURNING or equivalent during INSERT execution in order to load
      newly generated primary keys and other column defaults in one execution,
      which are then available via inserted_primary_key.
      If an insert statement has returning() specified explicitly,
      the "implicit" functionality is not used and inserted_primary_key
      will not be available.

    dbapi_type_map
      A mapping of DB-API type objects present in this Dialect's
      DB-API implementation mapped to TypeEngine implementations used
      by the dialect.

      This is used to apply types to result sets based on the DB-API
      types present in cursor.description; it only takes effect for
      result sets against textual statements where no explicit
      typemap was present.

    colspecs
      A dictionary of TypeEngine classes from sqlalchemy.types mapped
      to subclasses that are specific to the dialect class.  This
      dictionary is class-level only and is not accessed from the
      dialect instance itself.

    supports_default_values
      Indicates if the construct ``INSERT INTO tablename DEFAULT
      VALUES`` is supported

    supports_sequences
      Indicates if the dialect supports CREATE SEQUENCE or similar.

    sequences_optional
      If True, indicates if the "optional" flag on the Sequence() construct
      should signal to not generate a CREATE SEQUENCE. Applies only to
      dialects that support sequences. Currently used only to allow PostgreSQL
      SERIAL to be used on a column that specifies Sequence() for usage on
      other backends.

    supports_native_enum
      Indicates if the dialect supports a native ENUM construct.
      This will prevent types.Enum from generating a CHECK
      constraint when that type is used.

    supports_native_boolean
      Indicates if the dialect supports a native boolean construct.
      This will prevent types.Boolean from generating a CHECK
      constraint when that type is used.

    dbapi_exception_translation_map
       A dictionary of names that will contain as values the names of
       pep-249 exceptions ("IntegrityError", "OperationalError", etc)
       keyed to alternate class names, to support the case where a
       DBAPI has exception classes that aren't named as they are
       referred to (e.g. IntegrityError = MyException).   In the vast
       majority of cases this dictionary is empty.

class CreateEnginePlugin(object):

    The purpose of :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` is to allow third-party
    systems to apply engine, pool and dialect level event listeners without
    the need for the target application to be modified; instead, the plugin
    names can be added to the database URL.  Target applications for
    :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` include:

    * connection and SQL performance tools, e.g. which use events to track
      number of checkouts and/or time spent with statements

    * connectivity plugins such as proxies

    Plugins are registered using entry points in a similar way as that
    of dialects::

        entry_points={
            'sqlalchemy.plugins': [
                'myplugin = myapp.plugins:MyPlugin'
            ]

    A plugin that uses the above names would be invoked from a database
    URL as in::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test?plugin=myplugin")

    The ``plugin`` argument supports multiple instances, so that a URL
    may specify multiple plugins; they are loaded in the order stated
    in the URL::

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/"
          "test?plugin=plugin_one&plugin=plugin_twp&plugin=plugin_three")

    A plugin can receive additional arguments from the URL string as
    well as from the keyword arguments passed to :func:`.create_engine`.
    The :class:`.URL` object and the keyword dictionary are passed to the
    constructor so that these arguments can be extracted from the url's
    :attr:`.URL.query` collection as well as from the dictionary::

        class MyPlugin(CreateEnginePlugin):
            def __init__(self, url, kwargs):
                self.my_argument_one = url.query.pop('my_argument_one')
                self.my_argument_two = url.query.pop('my_argument_two')
                self.my_argument_three = kwargs.pop('my_argument_three', None)

    Arguments like those illustrated above would be consumed from the
    following::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/"
          "test?plugin=myplugin&my_argument_one=foo&my_argument_two=bar",
          my_argument_three='bat')

    The URL and dictionary are used for subsequent setup of the engine
    as they are, so the plugin can modify their arguments in-place.
    Arguments that are only understood by the plugin should be popped
    or otherwise removed so that they aren't interpreted as erroneous
    arguments afterwards.

    When the engine creation process completes and produces the
    :class:`.Engine` object, it is again passed to the plugin via the
    :meth:`.CreateEnginePlugin.engine_created` hook.  In this hook, additional
    changes can be made to the engine, most typically involving setup of
    events (e.g. those defined in :ref:`core_event_toplevel`).
