This is the main index page of your documentation. It should be written in
`reStructuredText format <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

You can generate your documentation in HTML format by running this command::

    setup.py pudge

For this to work you will need to download and install `buildutils`_,
`pudge`_, and `pygments`_.  The ``pudge`` command is disabled by
default; to ativate it in your project, run::

    setup.py addcommand -p buildutils.pudge_command

.. _buildutils: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buildutils
.. _pudge: http://pudge.lesscode.org/
.. _pygments: http://pygments.org/
