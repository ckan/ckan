Install front end dependencies
==============================

The front end stylesheets are written using
`LESS <http://lesscss.org/>`_. This depends on
`node <http://nodejs.org/>`_ being installed on the system.

Instructions for installing node can be found on the `project
website <http://nodejs.org/>`_.

On ubuntu node can be installed using the following commands:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
    $ sudo apt-get install npm    # node package manager

LESS can then be installed via the node package manager which is bundled
with node (or installed with apt). ``cd`` into the ``pyenv/src/ckan`` and run:

::

    $ npm install less

A watcher script can then be used to compile the CSS whenever the LESS
changes:

::

    $ ./bin/less

This will generate a main.debug.css file. To build the production CSS to
commit into the repository run:

::

    $ ./bin/less --production

This will generate the main.css file that should be committed for use in
packaged versions of CKAN. (This command will actually start a watch
script so you'll have to exit it with ``ctrl-c`` to actually commit the
file.)

(If someone could move this into a paster script that would be great)

File Structure
==============

All front-end files to be served via a web server are located in the
``public`` directory (in the case of the new CKAN base theme it's
``public/base``).

::

    css/
      main.css
    less/
      main.less
      ckan.less
    javascript/
      main.js
      utils.js
      components/
    vendor/
      jquery.js
      jquery.plugin.js
      underscore.js
      bootstrap.css
    test/
      index.html
      spec/
        main.spec.js
        utils.spec.js
      vendor/
        mocha.js
        mocha.css
        chai.js

All files and directories should be lowercase with hyphens used to
separate words.

css
    Should contain any site specific CSS files including compiled
    production builds generated by LESS.
less
    Should contain all the less files for the site. Additional vendor
    styles should be added to the *vendor* directory and included in
    main.less.
javascript
    Should contain all website files. These can be structured
    appropriately. It is recommended that *main.js* be used as the
    bootstrap filename that sets up the page.
vendor
    Should contain all external dependencies. These should not contain
    version numbers in the filename. This information should be
    available in the header comment of the file. Library plugins should
    be prefixed with the library name. If a dependency has many files
    (such as bootstrap) then the entire directory should be included as
    distributed by the maintainer.
test
    Contains the test runner *index.html*. *vendor* contains all test
    dependencies and libraries. *spec* contains the actual test files.
    Each test file should be the filename with *.spec* appended.

Stylesheets
===========

Because all the stylesheets are using LESS we need to compile them
before beginning development. In production CKAN will look for the
``main.css`` file which is included in the repository. In development
CKAN looks for the file ``main.debug.css`` which you will need to
generate by running:

::

    $ ./bin/less

This will watch for changes to all of the less files and automatically
rebuild the CSS for you. To quit the script press ``ctrl-c``.

There are many LESS scripts which attempt to group the styles in useful
groups.

The main two are:

-  main.less: This contains *all* the styles for the website including
   dependancies and local styles. The only files that are excluded here
   are those that are conditionally loaded such as IE only CSS and large
   external apps (like recline) that only appear on a single page.
-  ckan.less: This includes all the local ckan stylesheets.

There is a very basic pattern primer available at:

::

    http://localhost:5000/test/primer/

This should contain common components and slowly be expanded to provide
documentation on the CKAN markup and styles. But for the moment it
serves as useful unit tests for the CSS.

JavaScript
==========

The core of the CKAN JavaScript is split up into three areas.

-  Core (such as i18n, pub/sub and API clients)
-  Modules (small HTML components or widgets)
-  jQuery Plugins (very small reusable components)

Core
----

Everything in the CKAN application lives on the ``ckan`` namespace.
Currently there are four main components that make up the core.

Modules
~~~~~~~

Modules are the core of the CKAN website, every component that is
interactive on the page should be a module. These are then initialized
by including a ``data-module`` attribute on an element on the page.

The idea is to create small isolated components that can easily be
tested. They should ideally not use any global objects, all
functionality should be provided to them via a "sandbox" object.

There is a global factory that can be used to create new modules.

::

    ckan.module('my-module', {
      initialize: function () {
        // Called when a module is created.
      },
      teardown: function () {
        // Called before a module is removed from the page.
      }
    });

jQuery and Localisation methods are available via
``this.sandbox.jQuery`` and ``this.sandbox.translate()`` respectively.
To save typing these two common objects we can take advantage of
JavaScript closures and use an alternative module syntax that accepts a
factory function.

::

    ckan.module('my-module', function (jQuery, translate) {
      return {
        initialize: function () {
          // Called when a module is created.
          // jQuery and translate are available here.
        },
        teardown: function () {
          // Called before a module is removed from the page.
        }
      }
    });

Pub/Sub
~~~~~~~

There is a simple pub/sub module included under ``ckan.pubsub`` it's
methods are available to modules via
``this.sandbox.publish/subscribe/unsubscribe``. This can be used to
publish messages between modules.

Client
~~~~~~

Ideally no module should use jQuery.ajax() to make XHR requests to the
CKAN API, all functionality should be provided via the client object.

::

    ckan.module('my-module', {
      initialize: function () {
        this.sandbox.client.getCompletions(this.options.completionsUrl);
      }
    });

i18n/Jed
~~~~~~~~

`Jed <http://slexaxton.github.com/Jed/>`_ is a Gettext implementation in
JavaScript. It is used throughout the application to create translatable
strings. An instance of Jed is available on the ``ckan.i18n`` object.

Modules get access to the ``translate()`` function via both the initial
factory function and the ``this.sandbox.translate()`` object.

::

    ckan.module('my-module', function (jQuery, translate) {
      return {/* my module */};
    });

    ckan.module('my-module', {
      initialize: function () {
        this.sandbox.translate('my string');
      }
    });

String interpolation can be provided using the `sprintf formatting <http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/javascript-sprintf>`_.
We always use the named arguments to keep in line with the Python translations.
And we name the translate function passed into ``ckan.module()`` ``_``.

::

    ckan.module('my-module', function (jQuery, _) {
      return {
        initialize: function () {
          // Keyword arguments
          _('Hello %(name)s').fetch({name: 'Bill'}); // Hello Bill

          // Multiple.
          _("I like your %(color)s %(fruit)s.").fetch({color: 'red', fruit: 'apple');

          // Plurals.
          _("I have %(num)d apple.")
            .ifPlural(2, "I have %(num)d apples.")
            .fetch({num: 2, fruit: 'apple');
        }
      };
    });

Modules
-------

Life Cycle
~~~~~~~~~~

CKAN modules are intialised on document ready. The
``ckan.module.initialize()`` will look for all elements on the page with
a ``data-module`` attribute and attempt to create an instance.

::

    <select name="format" data-module="autocomplete"></select>

The module will be created with the element, an options object extracted
from ``data-module-*`` attributes and a new sandbox instance.

Once created the modules ``initialize()`` method will be called allowing
the module to set themselves up.

Modules should also provide a ``teardown()`` method this isn't used at
the moment except in the unit tests to restore state but may become
useful in the future.

Talking to each other
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules should use the publish/subscribe methods to talk to each other
and allow different areas of the UI to update where relevant.

::

    ckan.module('language-picker', {
      initialize: function () {
        var sandbox = this.sandbox;
        this.el.on('change', function () {
          sandbox.publish('change:lang', this.selected);
        });
      }
    });

    ckan.module('language-notifier', {
      initialize: function () {
        this.sandbox.subscribe('change:lang', function (lang) {
          alert('language is now ' + lang);
        });
      }
    });

Internationalisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All strings within modules should be internationalised. Strings can be
set in the ``options.i18n`` object and there is a ``.i18n()`` helper for
retrieving them.

::

    ckan.module('language-picker', function (jQuery, _) {
      return {
        options: {
          i18n: {
            hello: _('Hello')
          }
        },
        initialize: function () {
          this.i18n('hello'); // "Hello"
        }
      }
    });

String interpolation can be provided by passing extra arguments.

::

    ckan.module('language-picker', function (jQuery, _) {
      return {
        options: {
          i18n: {
            hello: _('Hello %(name)s')
          }
        },
        initialize: function () {
          var name = 'Dave';
          this.i18n('hello', {name: name}); // "Hello Dave"
        }
      }
    });

Plural versions can also be provided using a function and the chained
Jed API.

::

    ckan.module('language-picker', function (jQuery, _) {
      return {
        options: {
          i18n: {
            apples: function (params) {
              var n = params.num;
              return _('I have %(num)d apple').isPlural(n, 'I have %(num)d apples');
            }
          }
        },
        initialize: function () {
          var total = 1;
          this.i18n('apples', {num: total}); // "I have 1 apple"
          this.i18n('apples', {num: 3});     // "I have 3 apples"
        }
      }
    });

jQuery Plug-ins
---------------

Any functionality that is not directly related to ckan should be
packaged up in a jQuery plug-in if possible. This keeps the modules
containing only ckan specific code and allows plug-ins to be reused on
other sites.

Examples of these are ``jQuery.fn.slug()``, ``jQuery.fn.slugPreview()``
and ``jQuery.proxyAll()``.

Unit Tests
----------

There is currently a test suite available at:

::

    http://localhost:5000/base/test/index.html

Every core component, module and plugin should have a set of unit tests.
Tests can be filtered using the ``grep={regexp}`` query string
parameter.

::

    http://localhost:5000/base/test/index.html?grep=^jQuery

The libraries used for the tests are as follows.

-  `Mocha <http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/>`_: A test runner using
   a BDD style syntax.
-  `Chai <http://chaijs.com>`_: An assertion library (we use the assert
   style).
-  `Sinon <http://sinonjs.org>`_: A stubbing library, can stub objects,
   timers and ajax requests.
