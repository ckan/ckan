Publishing Datasets
===================

This tutorial provides a walk-through of publishing data on CKAN.

.. note: Often, a given CKAN instance will have a custom publishing workflow.
         The tutorial presented here assumes the standard, default, workflow as
         deployed on e.g. the DataHub_.

Step 0 - Identify Some Data to Use
----------------------------------

For the purposes of this tutorial you will want to have some data which you
want to publish on your CKAN instance (we will be using the DataHub_ in our
examples but please replace with your own instance). If you don't have one to
hand we suggest you just use some of the raw data from this `Gold Prices
Dataset`_ on the DataHub (just pretend you dug it up somewhere on the
Internet!).
