=====================================
Best practices for writing extensions
=====================================


------------------------------
Follow CKAN's coding standards
------------------------------

See :doc:`/contributing/index`.


.. _use the plugins toolkit:

-------------------------------------------------
Use the plugins toolkit instead of importing CKAN
-------------------------------------------------

Try to limit your extension to interacting with CKAN only through CKAN's
:doc:`plugin interfaces <plugin-interfaces>` and
:doc:`plugins toolkit <plugins-toolkit>`. It's a good idea to keep your
extension code separate from CKAN as much as possible, so that internal changes
in CKAN from one release to the next don't break your extension.


---------------------------------
Don't edit CKAN's database tables
---------------------------------

An extension can create its own tables in the CKAN database, but it should *not*
write to core CKAN tables directly, add columns to core tables, or use foreign
keys against core tables.

.. _extensions db migrations:

------------------------------------------
Use migrations when introducing new models
------------------------------------------

Any new model provided by extension must use migration script for
creating and updating relevant tables. As well as core tables,
extensions should provide :ref:`revisioned workflow <db migrations>`
for reproducing correct state of DB. There are few convenient tools
available in CKAN for this purpose:

* New migration script can be created via CLI interface::

    ckan generate migration -p PLUGIN_NAME -m 'MIGRATION MESSAGE'

  One should take care and use actual plugin's name, not extension
  name instead of `PLUGIN_NAME`. This may become important when an
  extension provides multiple plugins, which contain migration
  scripts. If those scripts should be applied independently(i.e.,
  there is no sense in particular migrations, unless specific plugin
  is enabled), ``-p/--plugin`` option gives you enough
  control. Otherwise, if extenson named `ckanext-ext` contains just
  single plugin `ext`, command for new migration will look like `ckan
  generate migration -p ext`.

  Migration scripts are created under
  `EXTENSION_ROOT/ckanext/EXTENSION_NAME/migration/PLUGIN_NAME/versions`. Once
  created, migration script contains empty `upgrade` and `downgrade`
  function, which need to be updated according to desired
  changes. More details abailable in `Alembic
  <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#create-a-migration-script>`_
  documentation.


* Apply migration script with::

    ckan db upgrade -p PLUGIN_NAME

  This command will check current state of DB and apply only required
  migrations, so it's idempotent.


* Revert changes introduced by plugin's migration scripts with::

    ckan db downgrade -p PLUGIN_NAME

------------------------------------
Declare models using shared metadata
------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.10

Use the :py:class:`~ckan.plugins.toolkit.BaseModel` class from the plugins toolkit to implement SQLAlchemy
declarative models in your extension. It is attached to the core metadata object, so it helps SQLAlchemy
to resolve cascade relationships and control orphan removals. In addition, the ``clean_db`` test
fixture will also handle these tables when cleaning the database.

Example::

    from ckan.plugins import toolkit

    class ExtModel(toolkit.BaseModel):
        __tablename__ = "ext_model"
        id = Column(String(50), primary_key=True)
        ...

In previous versions of CKAN, you can link to the :py:obj:`ckan.model.meta.metadata` object
directly in your own class::

    import ckan.model as model
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

    Base = declarative_base(metadata=model.meta.metadata)

    class ExtModel(Base):
        __tablename__ = "ext_model"
        id = Column(String(50), primary_key=True)
        ...

-------------------------------------------------------
Implement each plugin class in a separate Python module
-------------------------------------------------------

This keeps CKAN's plugin loading order simple, see :ref:`ckan.plugins`.


.. _avoid name clashes:

------------------
Avoid name clashes
------------------
Many of the names you pick for your identifiers and files must be unique in
relation to the names used by core CKAN and other extensions. To avoid
conflicts you should prefix any public name that your extension introduces with
the name of your extension. For example:

* The names of *configuration settings* introduced by your extension should
  have the form ``my_extension.my_config_setting``.

* The names of *templates and template snippets* introduced by your extension
  should begin with the name of your extension::

      snippets/my_extension_useful_snippet.html

  If you have add a lot of templates you can also put them into a separate
  folder named after your extension instead.

* The names of *template helper functions* introduced by your extension should
  begin with the name of your extension. For example:

  .. literalinclude:: /../ckanext/example_theme_docs/v08_custom_helper_function/plugin.py
     :pyobject: ExampleThemePlugin.get_helpers

* The names of *JavaScript modules* introduced by your extension should begin
  with the name of your extension. For example
  ``assets/example_theme_popover.js``:

  .. literalinclude:: /../ckanext/example_theme_docs/v16_initialize_a_javascript_module/assets/example_theme_popover.js

* The names of *API action functions* introduced by your extension should begin
  with the name of your extension. For example
  ``my_extension_foobarize_everything``.

* The names of *background job queues* introduced by your extension should
  begin with the name of your extension. For example
  ``my_extension:super-special-job-queue``.

In some situations, a resource may even be shared between multiple CKAN
*instances*, which requires an even higher degree of uniqueness for the
corresponding names. In that case, you should also prefix your identifiers with
the CKAN site ID, which is available via

::

    try:
        # CKAN 2.7 and later
        from ckan.common import config
    except ImportError:
        # CKAN 2.6 and earlier
        from pylons import config

    site_id = config[u'ckan.site_id']

Currently this only affects the :ref:`Redis database <ckan.redis.url>`:

* All *keys in the Redis database* created by your extension should be prefixed
  with both the CKAN site ID and your extension's name.


-------------------------------------
Internationalize user-visible strings
-------------------------------------

All user-visible strings should be internationalized, see
:doc:`/contributing/string-i18n`.


---------------------------------------------
Add third party libraries to requirements.txt
---------------------------------------------

If your extension requires third party libraries, rather than
adding them to ``setup.py``, they should be added
to ``requirements.txt``, which can be installed with::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

To prevent accidental breakage of your extension through backwards-incompatible
behaviour of newer versions of your dependencies, their versions should be pinned,
such as::

  requests==2.7.0

On the flip side, be mindful that this could also create version conflicts with
requirements of considerably newer or older extensions.


--------------------------------------------------
Do not automatically modify the database structure
--------------------------------------------------

If your extension uses custom database tables then it needs to modify the
database structure, for example to add the tables after its installation or to
migrate them after an update. These modifications should not be performed
automatically when the extension is loaded, since this can lead to `dead-locks
and other problems`_.

Instead, create a :doc:`ckan command </maintaining/cli>` which can be run separately.

.. _csrf_best_practices:

----------------------------
Implementing CSRF protection
----------------------------

CKAN 2.10 introduces CSRF protection for all the frontend forms. Extensions are currently excluded from the CSRF protection to give time to update them, but CSRF protection will be enforced in the future.

To add CSRF protection to your extensions add the following helper call to your form templates::

    <form class="dataset-form form-horizontal" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      {{ h.csrf_input() }}

If your extension needs to support older CKAN versions, use the following::

    <form class="dataset-form form-horizontal" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      {{ h.csrf_input() if 'csrf_input' in h }}


Forms that are submitted via JavaScript modules also need to submit the CSRF token, hereâ€™s an example of how to append it to an existing form::

  // Get the csrf value from the page meta tag
  var csrf_value = $('meta[name=_csrf_token]').attr('content')
  // Create the hidden input
  var hidden_csrf_input = $('<input name="_csrf_token" type="hidden" value="'+csrf_value+'">')
  // Insert the hidden input at the beginning of the form
  hidden_csrf_input.prependTo(form)

API calls performed from JavaScript modules from the UI (which use cookie-based authentication) should also include the token, in this case in the ``X-CSRFToken`` header. CKAN Modules using the builtin `client <https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/frontend/index.html?#client>`_) to perform API calls will have the header added automatically. If you are performing API calls directly from a UI module you will need to add the header yourself.
