Best practices for writing extensions
-------------------------------------

Follow CKAN's coding standards
==============================

See :ref:`coding standards`.

Use the plugins toolkit instead of importing CKAN
=================================================

Try to limit your extension to interacting with CKAN only through CKAN's
:doc:`plugin interfaces <plugin-interfaces>` and
:doc:`plugins toolkit <plugins-toolkit>`. It's a good idea to keep your
extension code separate from CKAN as much as possible, so that internal changes
in CKAN from one release to the next don't break your extension.


Don't edit CKAN's database tables
=================================

An extension can create its own tables in the CKAN database, but it should *not*
write to core CKAN tables directly, add columns to core tables, or use foreign
keys against core tables.
