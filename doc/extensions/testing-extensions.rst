Testing extensions
==================

CKAN extensions can have their own tests that are run using ``pytest``
in much the same way as running CKAN's own tests (see :doc:`/contributing/test`).

Continuing with our :doc:`example_iauthfunctions extension <tutorial>`,
first we need a CKAN config file to be used when running our tests.
Create the file ``ckanext-iauthfunctions/test.ini`` with the following
contents::

    [app:main]
    use = config:../ckan/test-core.ini

The ``use`` line declares that this config file inherits the settings from the
config file used to run CKAN's own tests (``../ckan`` should be the path to
your CKAN source directory, relative to your ``test.ini`` file).

The ``test.ini`` file is a CKAN config file just like your |ckan.ini|
file, and it can contain any
:doc:`CKAN config file settings </maintaining/configuration>` that you want
CKAN to use when running your tests, for example::

    [app:main]
    use = config:../ckan/test-core.ini
    ckan.site_title = My Test CKAN Site
    ckan.site_description = A test site for testing my CKAN extension

Next, make the directory that will contain our test modules::

    mkdir ckanext-iauthfunctions/ckanext/iauthfunctions/tests/

Finally, create the file
``ckanext-iauthfunctions/ckanext/iauthfunctions/tests/test_iauthfunctions.py``
with the following contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../../ckanext/example_iauthfunctions/tests/test_example_iauthfunctions.py
   :end-before: @pytest.mark.ckan_config('ckan.plugins', 'example_iauthfunctions_v3')

To run these extension tests, ``cd`` into the ``ckanext-iauthfunctions``
directory and run this command::

    pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/iauthfunctions/tests

Some notes on how these tests work:

* Pytest has lots of useful functions for testing, see the
  `pytest documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_.

* We're calling :func:`ckan.tests.call_action` This is a convenience function
  that CKAN provides for its own tests.

* The CKAN core :doc:`/contributing/testing` can usefully be applied to writing tests for plugins.

* CKAN core provides:

  * :mod:`ckan.tests.factories` for creating test data

  * :mod:`ckan.tests.helpers` a collection of helper functions for use in tests

  * :mod:`ckan.tests.pytest_ckan.fixtures` for setting up the test environment

  which are also useful for testing extensions.

* You might also find it useful to read the
  `Flask testing documentation <https://flask-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html>`_ (or
  `Pylons testing documentation <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/testing.html>`_
  for plugins using legacy pylons controllers).

* Avoid importing the plugin modules directly into your test modules
  (e.g from example_iauthfunctions import plugin_v5_custom_config_setting).
  This causes the plugin to be registered and loaded before the entire test run,
  so the plugin will be loaded for all tests. This can cause conflicts and
  test failures.
