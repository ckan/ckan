==============================
Option 1: Package Installation
==============================

This section describes how to install CKAN from packages. This is the
recommended and the easiest way to install CKAN, but it requires **Ubuntu 12.04
64-bit**. If you're not using Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, or if you're installing CKAN
for development, you should follow :doc:`install-from-source` instead.

If you run into problems, see :doc:`common-error-messages`.

.. _run-package-installer:

1. Install the CKAN Package
---------------------------

On your Ubuntu 12.04 system, open a terminal and run these commands to install
CKAN:

#. Update Ubuntu's package index::

    sudo apt-get update

#. Install the Ubuntu packages that CKAN requires::

    sudo apt-get install -y nginx apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi libpq5

#. Download the CKAN package::

    wget http://packages.ckan.org/python-ckan-2.0_amd64.deb

   .. note:: If ``wget`` is not present, you can install it
       via::

        sudo apt-get install wget

#. Install the CKAN package::

    sudo dpkg -i python-ckan-2.0_amd64.deb

.. note:: If you get the following error it means that for some reason the
 Apache WSGI module was not enabled::

    Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ckan_default:
    Invalid command 'WSGISocketPrefix', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
    Action 'configtest' failed.
    The Apache error log may have more information.
       ...fail!

 You can enable it by running these commands in a terminal::

    sudo a2enmod wsgi
    sudo service apache2 restart


2. Install PostgreSQL and Solr
------------------------------

.. tip::

   You can install |postgres|, |solr| and CKAN on different servers. Just
   change the :ref:`sqlalchemy.url` and :ref:`solr_url` settings in your
   |production.ini| file to reference your |postgres| and |solr| servers.

#. Install |postgres| and |solr|, run this command in a terminal::

    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql solr-jetty

   The install will whirr away, then towards the end you'll see this::

     * Not starting jetty - edit /etc/default/jetty and change NO_START to be 0 (or comment it out).

#. Follow the instructions in :ref:`solr-single` or :ref:`solr-multi-core` to
   setup |solr|.

#. Follow the instructions in :ref:`postgres-setup` to setup |postgres|,
   then edit the :ref:`sqlalchemy.url` option in your |production.ini| file and
   set the correct password, database and database user.

#. Initialize your CKAN database by running this command in a terminal::

    sudo ckan db init

#. Optionally, setup the :doc:`DataStore <datastore>` by following the
   instructions in :doc:`datastore-setup`.

#. Also optionally, you can enable file uploads by following the
   instructions in :doc:`filestore`.

3. You're done!
---------------

Open http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. You should see the CKAN front
page, which will look something like this:

.. image :: images/9.png

You can now proceed to :doc:`post-installation`.


.. _upgrading-to-2.0:

Upgrading to CKAN 2.0
---------------------

.. note::

   If you want to upgrade to a 1.X version of CKAN rather than to CKAN 2.0, see
   the `documentation
   <http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-1.8/install-from-package.html#upgrading-a-package-install>`_
   relevant to the old CKAN packaging system.

The CKAN 2.0 package requires Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, whereas previous CKAN
packages used Ubuntu 10.04. CKAN 2.0 also introduces many
backwards-incompatible feature changes (see :doc:`the changelog <CHANGELOG>`).
So it's not possible to automatically upgrade to a CKAN 2.0 package install.

However, you can install CKAN 2.0 (either on the same server that contained
your CKAN 1.x site, or on a different machine) and then manually migrate your
database and any custom configuration, extensions or templates to your new CKAN
2.0 site. We will outline the main steps for migrating below.

#. Create a dump of your CKAN 1.x database::

    sudo -u ckanstd /var/lib/ckan/std/pyenv/bin/paster --plugin=ckan db dump db-1.x.dump --config=/etc/ckan/std/std.ini

#. If you want to install CKAN 2.0 on the same server that your CKAN 1.x site
   was on, uninstall the CKAN 1.x package first::

    sudo apt-get autoremove ckan

#. Install CKAN 2.0, either from a :doc:`package install <install-from-package>`
   if you have Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, or from a
   :doc:`source install <install-from-source>` otherwise.

#. Load your database dump from CKAN 1.x into CKAN 2.0. This will migrate all
   of your datasets, resources, groups, tags, user accounts, and other data to
   CKAN 2.0. Your database schema will be automatically upgraded, and your
   search index rebuilt.

   First, activate your CKAN virtual environment and change to the ckan dir:

   .. parsed-literal::

    |activate|
    cd |virtualenv|/src/ckan

   Now, load your database. **This will delete any data already present in your
   new CKAN 2.0 database**. If you've installed CKAN 2.0 on a different
   machine from 1.x, first copy the database dump file to that machine.
   Then run these commands:

   .. parsed-literal::

     paster db clean -c |production.ini|
     paster db load -c |production.ini| db-1.x.dump

#. If you had any custom config settings in your CKAN 1.x instance that you
   want to copy across to your CKAN 2.0 instance, then update your CKAN 2.0
   |production.ini| file with these config settings. Note that not all CKAN 1.x
   config settings are still supported in CKAN 2.0, see :doc:`configuration`
   for details.

   In particular, CKAN 2.0 introduces an entirely new authorization system
   and any custom authorization settings you had in CKAN 1.x will have to be
   reconsidered for CKAN 2.0. See :doc:`authorization` for details.

#. If you had any extensions installed in your CKAN 1.x instance that you also
   want to use with your CKAN 2.0 instance, install those extensions in CKAN
   2.0. Not all CKAN 1.x extensions are compatible with CKAN 2.0. Check each
   extension's documentation for CKAN 2.0 compatibility and install
   instructions.

#. If you had any custom templates in your CKAN 1.x instance, these will need
   to be adapted before they can be used with CKAN 2.0. CKAN 2.0 introduces
   an entirely new template system based on Jinja2 rather than on Genshi.
   See :doc:`theming` for details.
