Features
========

The following sections describe features (both core features and built-in
extensions) that come with CKAN, including how to enable, setup and configure
each feature or extension.

Beyond these core features, further features can be added to CKAN by
downloading and installing external extensions. A good place to find extensions
is the
`list of extensions on the CKAN wiki <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/wiki/List-of-extensions>`_.
