CKAN uses Solr_ as its search engine, and uses a customized Solr schema file
that takes into account CKAN's specific search needs. Now that we have CKAN
installed, we need to install and configure Solr.


.. warning:: CKAN supports **Solr 8**. Starting from CKAN 2.10 this is the only Solr version supported. CKAN 2.9 can run with Solr 8 as long as it is patched to at least 2.9.5. CKAN 2.9 can also run against Solr 6 but this is not recommended as this Solr version does no longer receive security updates.


There are two supported ways to install Solr.

1. Using CKAN's official Docker_ images. This is generally the easiest one and the recommended one if you are developing CKAN locally
2. Installing Solr locally and configuring it with the CKAN schema. You can use this option if you can't or don't want to use Docker.


Installing Solr using Docker
============================

You will need to have Docker installed. Please refer to its `installation documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_ for details.

There are pre-configured Docker images for Solr for each CKAN version. Make sure to pick the image tag that matches your CKAN version (they are named ``ckan/ckan-solr:<Major version>.<Minor version>``). To start a local Solr service you can run:

   .. parsed-literal::

    docker run --name ckan-solr -p 8983:8983 -d ckan/ckan-solr:2.10

.. todo:: Switch to ``|current_minor_version|`` when we branch `dev-v2.10`

You can now jump to the `Next steps <#next-steps-with-solr>`_ section.

Installing Solr manually
========================

#. Download the latest supported version from the `Solr downloads page <https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html>`_. CKAN supports Solr version 8.x.

#. Extract the downloaded file to your desired location (adjust the Solr version number to the one you are using)::

    tar xzf solr-8.11.0.tgz

#. Change into the extracted directory::

    cd solr-8.11.0/

#. Start Solr::

    bin/solr start

#. Create a new core for CKAN::

    bin/solr create -c ckan

#. Replace the standard schema located in ``server/solr/ckan/conf/managed-schema`` with the CKAN one:

   .. parsed-literal::

    wget -O server/solr/ckan/conf/managed-schema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckan/ckan/master/ckan/config/solr/schema.xml


.. todo:: Switch to ``|current_release_tag|`` when we branch `dev-v2.10`

#. Restart Solr::

    bin/solr restart


Next steps with Solr
====================

To check that Solr started you can visit the web interface at http://localhost:8983/solr

.. warning:: The two installation methods above will leave you with a setup that is fine for local development, but Solr should never be exposed publicly in a production site. Pleaser refer to the `Solr documentation <https://solr.apache.org/guide/securing-solr.html>`_ to learn how to secure your Solr instance.


If you followed any of the instructions above, the CKAN Solr core will be available at http://localhost:8983/solr/ckan. If for whatever reason you ended up with a different one (eg with a different port, host or core name), you need to change the :ref:`solr_url` setting in your :ref:`config_file` (|ckan.ini|) to point to your Solr server, for example::

       solr_url=http://my-solr-host:8080/solr/ckan-2.10
