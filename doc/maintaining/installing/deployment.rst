==========================
Deploying a source install
==========================

Once you've installed CKAN from source by following the instructions in
:doc:`install-from-source`, you can follow these instructions to deploy
your CKAN site using a rudimentary web server, so that it's available
to the Internet.

Because CKAN uses WSGI, a standard interface between web servers and Python web
applications, CKAN can be used with a number of different web server and
deployment configurations, however the CKAN project has now standardized on one NGINX_ with uwsgi

.. _uwsgi: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _NGINX: http://nginx.org/
.. _Supervisor: http://http://supervisord.org/

This guide explains how to deploy CKAN using a uwsgi web server and proxied
with NGINX on an Ubuntu server. These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu
18.04.


----------------
1. Install Nginx
----------------

Install NGINX_ (a web server) which will proxy the content from one of the WSGI Servers
and add a layer of caching::

    sudo apt-get install nginx


.. _create-wsgi-script-file:

------------------------------
2. Create the WSGI script file
------------------------------

The WSGI script file can be copied from the CKAN distribution:
``sudo cp /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/wsgi.py /etc/ckan/default/``

Here is the file:

.. parsed-literal::

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import os
    from ckan.config.middleware import make_app
    from ckan.cli import CKANConfigLoader
    from logging.config import fileConfig as loggingFileConfig
    config_filepath = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'ckan.ini')
    abspath = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    loggingFileConfig(config_filepath)
    config = CKANConfigLoader(config_filepath).get_config()
    application = make_app(config)


The WSGI Server (configured next) will redirect requests to this
WSGI script file. The script file then handles those requests by directing them
on to your CKAN instance (after first configuring the Python environment for
CKAN to run in).


-------------------------
3. Create the WSGI Server
-------------------------

Make sure you have activated the Python virtual environment before running this command:

.. parsed-literal::

   |activate|

uwsgi
-----

Run ``pip install uwsgi``
The uwsgi configuration file can be copied from the CKAN distribution:
``sudo cp /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan-uwsgi.ini /etc/ckan/default/``

 Here is the file:

.. parsed-literal::
    [uwsgi]

    http            =  127.0.0.1:8080
    uid             =  www-data
    gid             =  www-data
    wsgi-file       =  /etc/ckan/default/wsgi.py
    virtualenv      =  /usr/lib/ckan/default
    module          =  wsgi:application
    master          =  true
    pidfile         =  /tmp/%n.pid
    harakiri        =  50
    max-requests    =  5000
    vacuum          =  true
    callable        =  application
    strict          =  true

If you notice database connection issues in the uwsgi log, try adding the following configurations to resolve them::

    enable-threads  = true
    lazy-apps       = true

-----------------------------------
4. Install Supervisor for the uwsgi
-----------------------------------

Install Supervisor_ (a Process Control System) used to control starting, stopping the
uwsgi or gunicorn servers::

  sudo apt-get install supervisor
  sudo service supervisor restart

uwsgi
-----

Create the  ``/etc/supervisor/conf.d/ckan-uwsgi.conf`` file

.. parsed-literal::

    [program:ckan-uwsgi]

    command=/usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/uwsgi -i /etc/ckan/default/ckan-uwsgi.ini

    ; Start just a single worker. Increase this number if you have many or
    ; particularly long running background jobs.
    numprocs=1
    process_name=%(program_name)s-%(process_num)02d

    ; Log files - change this to point to the existing CKAN log files
    stdout_logfile=/etc/ckan/default/uwsgi.OUT
    stderr_logfile=/etc/ckan/default/uwsgi.ERR

    ; Make sure that the worker is started on system start and automatically
    ; restarted if it crashes unexpectedly.
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true

    ; Number of seconds the process has to run before it is considered to have
    ; started successfully.
    startsecs=10

    ; Need to wait for currently executing tasks to finish at shutdown.
    ; Increase this if you have very long running tasks.
    stopwaitsecs = 600

    ; Required for uWSGI as it does not obey SIGTERM.
    stopsignal=QUIT


--------------------------
5. Install an email server
--------------------------

If one isn't installed already, install an email server to enable CKAN's email
features (such as sending traceback emails to sysadmins when crashes occur, or
sending new activity :doc:`email notifications </maintaining/email-notifications>`
to users). For example, to install the `Postfix <http://www.postfix.org/>`_
email server, do::

    sudo apt-get install postfix

When asked to choose a Postfix configuration, choose *Internet Site* and press
return.



-------------------------------
6. Create the NGINX config file
-------------------------------

Create your site's NGINX config file at |nginx_config_file|, with the
following contents:

.. parsed-literal::

    proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=cache:30m max_size=250m;
    proxy_temp_path /tmp/nginx_proxy 1 2;

    server {
        client_max_body_size 100M;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache cache;
            proxy_cache_bypass $cookie_auth_tkt;
            proxy_no_cache $cookie_auth_tkt;
            proxy_cache_valid 30m;
            proxy_cache_key $host$scheme$proxy_host$request_uri;
            # In emergency comment out line to force caching
            # proxy_ignore_headers X-Accel-Expires Expires Cache-Control;
        }

    }


To prevent conflicts, disable your default nginx sites and restart:

.. parsed-literal::

    sudo rm -vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sudo ln -s |nginx_config_file| /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ckan
    |restart_nginx|

------------------------
7. Access your CKAN site
------------------------


You should now be able to visit your server in a web browser and see your new
CKAN instance.


--------------------------------------
8. Setup a worker for background jobs
--------------------------------------
CKAN uses asynchronous :ref:`background jobs` for long tasks. These jobs are
executed by a separate process which is called a :ref:`worker <background jobs
workers>`.

To run the worker in a robust way, :ref:`install and configure Supervisor
<background jobs supervisor>`.



.. _deployment-changes-for-ckan-2.9:

-------------------------------
Deployment changes for CKAN 2.9
-------------------------------

This section describes how to update your deployment for CKAN 2.9 or later, if
you have an existing deployment of CKAN 2.8 or earlier. This is necessary,
whether you continue running CKAN on Python 2 or Python 3, because the WSGI
entry point for running CKAN has changed. If your existing deployment is
different to that described in the `official CKAN 2.8 deployment instructions
<https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/deployment.html>`_
(apache2 + mod_wsgi + nginx) then you'll need to adapt these instructions to
your setup.

We now recommend you activate the Python virtual environment in a different
place, compared to earlier CKAN versions. For the WSGI server, activation is done
in the uwsgi server config file (/etc/ckan/default/ckan-uwsgi.ini).

(In CKAN 2.8.x and earlier, the virtual environment was activated in the WSGI
script file.)
