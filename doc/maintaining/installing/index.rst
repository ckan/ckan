Installing CKAN
---------------

Before you can use CKAN on your own computer, you need to install it. There are
three ways to install CKAN:

#. Install from an operating system package
#. Install from source
#. Install using a Docker_ image

.. _Docker: http://www.docker.com/

From package is the quickest and easiest way to install CKAN, but it requires
Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit. **You should install CKAN from package if**:

* You want to install CKAN on an Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit server, *and*
* You only want to run one CKAN website per server

See :doc:`install-from-package`.

**You should install CKAN from source if**:

* You want to install CKAN on a 32-bit computer, *or*
* You want to install CKAN on a different version of Ubuntu, not 12.04, *or*
* You want to install CKAN on another operating system
  (eg. RedHat, CentOS, OS X), *or*
* You want to run multiple CKAN websites on the same server, *or*
* You want to install CKAN for development

See :doc:`install-from-source`.

**You should install using Docker if**:

* You want to deploy CKAN on any server that can run Docker, regardless of
  operating system
* You want a deployment mechanism that remains the same as you move from vanilla
  CKAN to a heavily customised deployment

See :doc:`install-using-docker`.

If you've already setup a CKAN website and want to upgrade it to a newer
version of CKAN, see :doc:`/maintaining/upgrading/index`.
