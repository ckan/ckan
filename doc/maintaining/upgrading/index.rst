==============

walk you through the steps to upgrade your CKAN site to a newer version of CKAN.

.. include:: /_supported_versions.rst

1. Prepare the upgrade
======================

*  Before upgrading your version of CKAN you should check that any custom
   templates or extensions you're using work with the new version of CKAN.
   For example, you could install the new version of CKAN in a new virtual
   environment and use that to test your templates and extensions.

* You should also read the :doc:`/changelog` to see if there are any extra
  notes to be aware of when upgrading to the new version.

.. warning:: You should always **backup your CKAN database** before upgrading CKAN. If something
   goes wrong with the CKAN upgrade you can use the backup to restore the database
   to its pre-upgrade state. See :ref:`Backup your CKAN database <db dumping and loading>`

The process of upgrading CKAN differs depending on whether you have a package
install or a source install of CKAN, and whether you're upgrading to a
