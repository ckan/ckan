Welcome to CKAN's Administration Guide
=======================================

This Administration Guide covers how to set up and manage `CKAN <http://ckan.org>`_ (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) software. 

* The first two sections cover your two options for installing CKAN: package or source install.
* The rest of the first half of the Guide, up to :doc:`authorization`, cover setup and basic admin. 
* The second half of the Guide, from :doc:`prepare-extensions` onwards, covers advanced tasks, including extensions and forms. 

For high-level information on what CKAN is, see the `CKAN website <http://ckan.org>`_.
