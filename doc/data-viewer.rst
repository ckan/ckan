===========
Data Viewer
===========

The CKAN resource page can contain a preview of the resource's data.
This works by either:

1. Embedding the data into the page, either directly or by loading the data
   in an iframe.
2. Using a custom widget (such as `Recline <http://okfnlabs.org/recline>`_)
   to view the data.

Generally, the decision as to which action to take is determined by the type of
resource being viewed.
In general, images will be directly embedded, unstructured or plain text
files will be loaded in an iframe, and more complex data types will need to
use a custom widget.

The data preview functionality that is provided by CKAN is described in
the following sections:

* :ref:`image-preview`
* :ref:`data-explorer`
* :ref:`text-preview`
* :ref:`pdf-preview`
* :ref:`resource-proxy`
* :ref:`embed-previews`

These sections list the resource formats that each extension can preview and
provide instructions for how to enable each extension.
It is also possible for developers to create new extensions that can preview
different types of resources.
For more information on this topic see
`Writing Extensions <extensions/index>`_.


.. _image-preview:

Viewing images and text files
-----------------------------

**Configuration required:** None.
Images and text files (that match one of the file types given below) will be
previewed automatically by default.

**Resource formats:** images, plain text (details below).

By default, the following types of resources will be embedded directly into
the resource read page:

* ``png``
* ``jpg``
* ``jpeg``
* ``gif``

The types of resources that are embedded directly can be specified in the
CKAN config file. See :ref:`ckan.preview.direct` for more information.

The following types of resources will be loaded in an iframe if there is no
extension that can preview these types:

* ``plain``
* ``txt``
* ``html``
* ``htm``
* ``xml``
* ``rdf+xml``
* ``owl+xml``
* ``n3``
* ``n-triples``
* ``turtle``
* ``atom``
* ``rss``

The types of resources that are loaded in an iframe can be specified in the
CKAN config file. See :ref:`ckan.preview.loadable` for more information.

Note that these documents will be directly linked by the browser, so the
way in which they are shown may vary. If you want to ensure for instance that
XML based documents are correctly previewed, have a look at `Viewing highlighted XML, JSON and plain text data`_.


.. _data-explorer:

Viewing structured data: the Data Explorer
------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   the ``recline_preview`` extension is new in CKAN 2.0.

**Configuration required:** The ``recline_preview`` extension must be added to
``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN configuration file.
This extension is part of CKAN and so does not need to be installed separately.

**Resource formats:** DataStore, ``csv``, ``xls``.

Structured data can be previewed using the
`Recline <http://okfnlabs.org/recline>`_ Data Explorer.
The Data Explorer provides a rich, queryable view of the data, and allows the
data to be filtered, graphed and mapped.

To be viewed, the data must either be:

1. In the CKAN `DataStore <datastore.html>`_.
   This is the recommended way to preview structured data.

Or:

2. In ``csv`` or ``xls`` format.
   In this case, CKAN will first have to try to convert the file into a more
   structured format by using the
   `Dataproxy <https://github.com/okfn/dataproxy>`_.
   This is an automatic process that does not require any additional
   configuration.
   However, as the resource must be downloaded by the Dataproxy service and
   then analysed before it is viewed, this option is generally slower and less
   reliable than viewing data that is in the DataStore.


.. _text-preview:

Viewing highlighted XML, JSON and plain text data
-------------------------------------------------

**Configuration required:** The ``text_preview`` extension must be added to
``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN configuration file.
This extension is part of CKAN and does not need to be installed
separately.

**Resource formats:**

* ``json``, ``gjson``, ``geojson``
   (can be configured by setting ``ckan.preview.json_formats``)
* ``jsonp``
   (can be configured  by setting ``ckan.preview.jsonp_formats``)
* ``xml``, ``rdf``, ``rdf+xml``, ``owl+xml``, ``atom``, ``rss``
   (can be configured  by setting ``ckan.preview.xml_formats``)
* ``text/plain``, ``txt``, ``plain``
   (can be configured  by setting ``ckan.preview.text_formats``)

The ``text_preview`` extension provides previews of many file types that have
been added to a CKAN instance.  To view the data the resource format must be
set to one of the resource formats from above (case insensitive).

.. seealso::

   :ref:`The resourceproxy extension <resource-proxy>`

     If you want to preview linked-to text files (and not only files that have
     been uploaded to CKAN) you need to enable the ``resource_proxy`` extension
     as well.


.. _pdf-preview:

Viewing PDF documents
---------------------

**Configuration required:** The ``pdf_preview`` extension must be added to
``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN configuration file.  This extension is part of
CKAN and does not need to be installed separately.

**Resource formats:** ``pdf``, ``x-pdf``, ``acrobat``, ``vnd.pdf``.

The ``pdf_preview`` extension provides previews of any ``pdf`` documents that
have been added to a CKAN instance.  This extension uses Mozilla's `pdf.js
<http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js>`_ library.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`The resourceproxy extension <resource-proxy>`

     If you want to preview linked-to PDF files (and not only files that have
     been uploaded to CKAN) you need to enable the ``resource_proxy`` extension
     as well.


.. _resource-proxy:

Viewing remote resources: the resource proxy
--------------------------------------------

**Configuration required:** The ``resource_proxy`` extension must be added to
``ckan.plugins`` in your CKAN configuration file.
This extension is part of CKAN and so does not need to be installed separately.

This extension must be enabled if you wish to preview resources that are on a
different domain. That means if this extension is not enabled, e.g.
PDF, or JSON files that are on ``www.example.com`` while CKAN is on
``www.ckan.org`` cannot be previewed by any extension.

Previewing is prevented by the
`same origin policy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy>`_ which
prevents files from different domains (different *origins*) from being loaded
into browsers. This extension gets around the same origin policy by pretending
that all files are served from the same domain (same *origin*) that
CKAN is on (e.g. ``www.ckan.org``).

If you are writing a custom preview extension that requires resources to be
proxied, you need to replace the URL that is used to load the file. This can
be done using the function :func:`ckanext.resourceproxy.plugin.get_proxified_resource_url`.
To find out whether the resource proxy is enabled, check ``ckan.resource_proxy_enabled``
from the config. You can find a complete example in the
`CKAN source <https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/793c2607199f2204307c12f83925257cd8eadc5e/ckanext/jsonpreview/plugin.py>`_.

.. _embed-previews:

Embedding Previews In Other Web Pages
-------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   The URL that is used to obtain the contents of the resource preview has
   changed from ``/dataset/{name}/resource/{resource_id}/embed``
   to ``/dataset/{name}/resource/{resource_id}/preview``.

For each resource, the preview content can be viewed at
``/dataset/{dataset id}/resource/{resource id}/preview``.
The preview content can therefore be embedded in other web pages by loading
the contents of this URL in an iframe.
