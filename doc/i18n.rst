Internationalize CKAN
=====================

CKAN is used in many countries, and adding a new language to the web interface is a simple process. 

CKAN uses the url to determine which language is used. An example would be ``/fr/dataset`` would be shown in french.  If CKAN is running under a directory then an example would be ``/root/fr/dataset``.  For custom paths check the :ref:`ckan.root_path` config option.

.. Note: Storing metadata field values in more than one language is a separate topic. This is achieved by storing the translations in extra fields. A custom dataset form and dataset display template are recommended. Ask the CKAN team for more information.

Supported Languages
===================

CKAN already supports numerous languages. To check whether your language is supported, look in the source at ``ckan/i18n`` for translation files. Languages are named using two-letter ISO language codes (e.g. ``es``, ``de``).

If your language is present, you can switch the default language simply by setting the ``ckan.locale_default`` option in your CKAN config file, as described in :ref:`config-i18n`. For example, to switch to German::

 ckan.locale_default=de

If your language is not supported yet, the remainder of this section section provides instructions on how to prepare a translation file and add it to CKAN. 

Adding a New Language
=====================

If you want to add an entirely new language to CKAN, you have two options.

* :ref:`i18n-transifex`. Creating translation files using Transifex, the open source translation software. 
* :ref:`i18n-manual`. Creating translation files manually in your own branch.

.. note:: Translating CKAN in Transifex is only enabled when a 'call for translations' is issued.

.. _i18n-transifex:

Transifex Setup
---------------

Transifex, the open translation platform, provides a simple web interface for writing translations and is widely used for CKAN internationalization. 

Using Transifex makes it easier to handle collaboration, with an online editor that makes the process more accessible.

Existing CKAN translation projects can be found at: https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ckan/teams/

When leading up to a CKAN release, the strings are loaded onto Transifex and ckan-discuss list is emailed to encourage translation work. When the release is done, the latest translations on Transifex are checked back into CKAN.


Transifex Administration
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Transifex workflow is as follows:

* Install transifex command-line utilities
* ``tx init`` in CKAN to connect to Transifex
* Run ``python setup.py extract_messages`` on the CKAN source
* Upload the local .pot file via command-line ``tx push``
* Get people to complete translations on Transifex
* Pull locale .po files via ``tx pull``
* ``python setup.py compile_catalog``
* Git Commit and push po and mo files


.. _i18n-manual:

Manual Setup
------------

.. note:: Please keep the CKAN core developers aware of new languages created in this way.

All the English strings in CKAN are extracted into the ``ckan.pot`` file, which can be found in ``ckan/i18n``.

.. note:: For information, the pot file was created with the ``babel`` command ``python setup.py extract_messages``.

0. Install Babel
++++++++++++++++

You need Python's ``babel`` library (Debian package ``python-pybabel``). Install it as follows with pip::

 pip -E pyenv install babel

1. Create a 'po' File for Your Language
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, grab the CKAN i18n repository::
 
 hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bboissin/ckan-i18n/

Then create a translation file for your language (a po file) using the pot file::

 python setup.py init_catalog --locale YOUR_LANGUAGE

Replace ``YOUR_LANGUAGE`` with the two-letter ISO language code (e.g. ``es``, ``de``).

In future, when the pot file is updated, you can update the strings in your po file, while preserving your po edits, by doing::

 python setup.py update_catalog --locale YOUR-LANGUAGE

2. Do the Translation
+++++++++++++++++++++

Edit the po file and translate the strings. For more information on how to do this, see `the Pylons book <http://pylonsbook.com/en/1.1/internationalization-and-localization.html>`_.

We recommend using a translation tool, such as `poedit <http://www.poedit.net/>`_, to check the syntax is correct. There are also extensions for editors such as emacs.

3. Commit the Translation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the po is complete, create a branch in your source, then commit it to the CKAN i18n repo::
 
 git checkout master
 git branch translation-YOUR_LANGUAGE
 git add ckan/i18n/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.po
 git commit -m '[i18n]: New language po added: YOUR_LANGUAGE' ckan/i18n/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.po
 git push origin translation-YOUR_LANGUAGE

4. Compile a Translation
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once you have created a translation (either with Transifex or manually) you can build the po file into a ``mo`` file, ready for deployment. 

With either method of creating the po file, it should be found in the CKAN i18n repository: ``ckan/i18n/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.po``

In this repo, compile the po file like this::

 python setup.py compile_catalog --locale YOUR_LANGUAGE

As before, replace ``YOUR_LANGUAGE`` with your language short code, e.g. ``es``, ``de``.

This will result in a binary 'mo' file of your translation at ``ckan/i18n/YOUR_LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.mo``.

5. (optional) Deploy the Translation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section explains how to deploy your translation automatically to your host, if you are using a remote host.

It assumes a standard layout on the server (you may want to check before you upload!) and that you are deploying to ``hu.ckan.net`` for language ``hu``.

Once you have a compiled translation file, for automated deployment to your host do::

 fab config_0:hu.ckan.net upload_i18n:hu

See the ``config_0`` options if more configuration is needed e.g. of host or location.

Alternatively, if you do not want to use fab, you can just scp::

 scp ckan.mo /home/okfn/var/srvc/hu.ckan.net/pyenv/src/ckan/ckan/i18n/hu/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.mo

6. Configure the Language
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Finally, once the mo file is in place, you can switch between the installed languages using the ``ckan.locale`` option in the CKAN config file, as described in :ref:`config-i18n`.
