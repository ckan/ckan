=====================================
Projects for beginner CKAN developers
=====================================

The `'Good for Contribution' <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues?labels=Good+for+Contribution&state=open>`_
label on Github lists issues which are feasible for people who aren't
intimately familiar with CKAN's internals. Many of them are things which would
be extremely helpful if they got done, but the core team never seems to get
around to them. They're all busy wrestling with the problems that do require
familiarity with the internals. We hope this will make it easier for more
people to assist the CKAN project, by giving new developers places to jump in.

These issues vary from simple text changes to more complicated code changes
that require more knowledge of Python and CKAN. Do not despair if any
individual task seems daunting; there's probably an easier one. If you have no
programming skills, we can still use your help with documentation or
translation.

If you wish to take up an issue make sure to keep in touch with the team on
the Github issue itself, the `ckan-dev mailing list`_, or the `CKAN chat on Gitter`_.
