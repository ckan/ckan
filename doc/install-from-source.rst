Option 2: Install from Source
=============================

This section describes how to install CKAN from source. Whereas :doc:`install-from-package` requires Ubuntu 10.04, this way of installing CKAN is more flexible to work with other distributions and operating systems. Please share your experiences on our wiki: http://wiki.ckan.org/Install

This is also the option to use if you are going to develop the CKAN source.

.. warning:: This option is more complex than :doc:`install-from-package`.

There is a page of help for dealing with :doc:`common-error-messages`.

For support during installation, please contact `the ckan-dev mailing list <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-dev>`_.

1. Ensure the required packages are installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have access to ``apt-get``, you can install these packages as follows:

::

    sudo apt-get install mercurial python-dev postgresql libpq-dev 
    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-virtualenv
    sudo apt-get install wget build-essential git-core subversion 
    sudo apt-get install solr-jetty openjdk-6-jdk

Otherwise, you should install these packages from source.

2. Create a Python virtual environment.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
In your home directory run the command below. It is currently important to
call your virtual environment ``pyenv`` so that the automated deployment tools
work correctly.

::

    cd ~
    virtualenv pyenv

.. tip ::

    If you don't have a ``python-virtualenv`` package in your distribution
    you can get a ``virtualenv.py`` script from within the 
    `virtualenv source distribution <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/>`_
    and then run ``python virtualenv.py pyenv`` instead.

To help with automatically installing CKAN dependencies we use a tool
called ``pip``. Make sure you have activated your environment (see step 3)
and then install it from an activated shell like this:

::

    easy_install pip

3. Activate your virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To work with CKAN it is best to adjust your shell settings so that your
shell uses the virtual environment you just created. You can do this like
so:

::

    . pyenv/bin/activate

When your shell is activated you will see the prompt change to something
like this:

::

    (pyenv)[ckan@host ~/]$

An activated shell looks in your virtual environment first when choosing
which commands to run. If you enter ``python`` now it will actually 
run ``~/pyenv/bin/python``, not the default ``/usr/bin/python`` which is what you want for CKAN. You can install python packages install this new environment and they won't affect the default ``/usr/bin/python``. This is necessary so you can use particular versions of python packages, rather than the ones installed with default paython, and these installs do not affect other python software on your system that may not be compatible with these packages.

4. Install CKAN source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is how to install the latest code (HEAD on the master branch)::

    pip install --ignore-installed -e git+https://github.com/okfn/ckan.git#egg=ckan

If you want to install a specific version, e.g. for v1.5.1::

    pip install --ignore-installed -e git+https://github.com/okfn/ckan.git@ckan-1.7#egg=ckan

5. Install Additional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CKAN has a set of dependencies it requires which you should install too.  These are listed in three text files: requires/lucid_*.txt, followed by WebOb explicitly.

First we install two of the three lists of dependencies:

::

    pip install --ignore-installed -r pyenv/src/ckan/requires/lucid_missing.txt -r pyenv/src/ckan/requires/lucid_conflict.txt
    pip install webob==1.0.8

The ``--ignore-installed`` option ensures ``pip`` installs software into
this virtual environment even if it is already present on the system.

WebOb has to be installed explicitly afterwards because by installing pylons with `--ignore-installed` you end up with a newer (incompatible) version than the one that Pylons and CKAN need.

Now to install the remaining dependencies in requires/lucid_present.txt and you are using Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 you can install the system versions::

    sudo apt-get install python-pybabel python-psycopg2
    sudo apt-get install python-pylons python-repoze.who 
    sudo apt-get install python-repoze.who-plugins python-tempita python-zope.interface
    
Alternatively, if you are not using Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 you'll need to install them like this:

::

    pip install --ignore-installed -r pyenv/src/ckan/requires/lucid_present.txt

At this point you will need to deactivate and then re-activate your
virtual environment to ensure that all the scripts point to the correct
locations:

::

    deactivate
    . pyenv/bin/activate

6. Setup a PostgreSQL database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List existing databases:

  ::

    sudo -u postgres psql -l

Check that the encoding of databases is 'UTF8', if not
internationalisation may be a problem. Since changing the encoding of PostgreSQL
may mean deleting existing databases, it is suggested that this is fixed before
continuing with the CKAN install.

Next you'll need to create a database user if one doesn't already exist.

  .. tip ::

    If you choose a database name, user or password which are different from the example values suggested below then you'll need to change the sqlalchemy.url value accordingly in the CKAN configuration file that you'll create in the next step.

Here we create a user called ``ckanuser`` and will enter ``pass`` for the password when prompted:

  ::

    sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R -P ckanuser

Now create the database (owned by ``ckanuser``), which we'll call ``ckantest``:

  ::

    sudo -u postgres createdb -O ckanuser ckantest

7. Create a CKAN config file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you are in an activated environment (see step 3) so that Python
Paste and other modules are put on the python path (your command prompt will
start with ``(pyenv)`` if you have) then change into the ``ckan`` directory
which will have been created when you installed CKAN in step 4 and create the
CKAN config file using Paste. These instructions call it ``development.ini`` since that is the required name for running the CKAN tests. But for a server deployment then you might want to call it say after the server hostname e.g. ``test.ckan.net.ini``.

  ::

    cd pyenv/src/ckan
    paster make-config ckan development.ini

If you used a different database name or password when creating the database
in step 6 you'll need to now edit ``development.ini`` and change the
``sqlalchemy.url`` line, filling in the database name, user and password you used.

  ::
  
    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://ckanuser:pass@localhost/ckantest

If you're using a remote host with password authentication rather than SSL authentication, use::

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://<user>:<password>@<remotehost>/ckan?sslmode=disable

.. caution ::

  Legacy installs of CKAN may have the config file in the pyenv directory, e.g. ``pyenv/ckan.net.ini``. This is fine but CKAN probably won't be able to find your ``who.ini`` file. To fix this edit ``pyenv/ckan.net.ini``, search for the line ``who.config_file = %(here)s/who.ini`` and change it to ``who.config_file = who.ini``.


8. Setup Solr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up Solr following the instructions on :ref:`solr-single` or :ref:`solr-multi-core` depending on your needs.

Set appropriate values for the ``ckan.site_id`` and ``solr_url`` config variables in your CKAN config file:

::

       ckan.site_id=my_ckan_instance
       solr_url=http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr

9. Create database tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have a configuration file that has the correct settings for
your database, you'll need to create the tables. Make sure you are still in an
activated environment with ``(pyenv)`` at the front of the command prompt and
then from the ``pyenv/src/ckan`` directory run this command.

If your config file is called development.ini:

::

 paster --plugin=ckan db init

or if your config file is something else, you need to specify it. e.g.::

 paster --plugin=ckan db init --config=test.ckan.net.ini

You should see ``Initialising DB: SUCCESS``. 

If the command prompts for a password it is likely you haven't set up the 
database configuration correctly in step 6.

10. Create the cache and session directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to create two directories for CKAN to put temporary files:
 * Pylon's cache directory, specified by `cache_dir` in the config file.
 * Repoze.who's OpenId session directory, specified by `store_file_path` in pyenv/ckan/who.ini

(from the ``pyenv/src/ckan`` directory or wherever your CKAN ini file you recently created is located):

  ::

    mkdir data sstore


11. Link to who.ini
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``who.ini`` (the Repoze.who configuration) needs to be accessible in the same directory as your CKAN config file. So if your config file is not in ``pyenv/src/ckan``, then cd to the directory with your config file and create a symbolic link to ``who.ini``. e.g.::

    ln -s pyenv/src/ckan/who.ini

12. Test the CKAN webserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Paste to serve CKAN from the command-line. This is a simple and lightweight way to serve CKAN and is especially useful for testing. However a production deployment will probably want to be served using Apache or nginx - see :doc:`post-installation`

.. note:: If you've started a new shell, you'll have to activate the environment again first - see step 3.

(from the ``pyenv/src/ckan`` directory):

  ::

    paster serve development.ini


13. Browse CKAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point your web browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

The CKAN homepage should load.

.. note:: if you installed CKAN on a remote machine then you will need to run the web browser on that same machine. For example run the textual web browser `w3m` in a separate ssh session to the one running `paster serve`.

Finally, if doing development you should make sure that tests pass, as described in :ref:`basic-tests`.

14. You are done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now proceed to :doc:`post-installation` which covers getting an administrator account created and deploying using Apache.
