=======================
Comments and Commenting
=======================

In a default CKAN install commenting is disabled. To enable it you have to
install and enable the disqus (commenting) extension:

https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-disqus/

Please read and follow the instructions there (as well as the standard
:doc:`extensions` documentation).

Important Note
--------------

Once installed and enabled, the presence of comments on a given page is
configured by your theme (see the documentation in the disqus extension for
details).

In the default CKAN theme (as of v1.7), comments will be shown only on dataset
and resource pages (and recent comments only on the
:doc:`administrative-dashboard`).
