Page View Tracking
==================

CKAN can track visits to pages of your site and use this tracking data to:

* Sort datasets by popularity
* Highlight popular datasets and resources
* Show view counts next to datasets and resources
* Show a list of the most popular datasets
* Export page-view data to a CSV file

    A CKAN extension that integrates Google Analytics into CKAN.


Enabling Page View Tracking
===========================

To enable page view tracking:

1. Set :ref:`ckan.tracking_enabled` to true in the ``[app:main]`` section of your
   CKAN configuration file (e.g. ``development.ini`` or ``production.ini``)::

    [app:main]
    ckan.tracking_enabled = true

   Save the file and restart your web server. CKAN will now record raw page
   view tracking data in your CKAN database as pages are viewed.

2. Setup a cron job to update the tracking summary data.

   For operations based on the tracking data CKAN uses a summarised version of
   the data, not the raw tracking data that is recorded "live" as page views
   happen. The ``paster tracking update`` and ``paster search-index rebuild``
   commands need to be run periodicially to update this tracking summary data.

   You can setup a cron job to run these commands. On most UNIX systems you can
   setup a cron job by running ``crontab -e`` in a shell to edit your crontab
   file, and adding a line to the file to specify the new job. For more
   information run ``man crontab`` in a shell. For example, here is a crontab
   line to update the tracking data and rebuild the search index hourly::

    @hourly /usr/lib/ckan/bin/paster --plugin=ckan tracking update -c /etc/ckan/production.ini && /usr/lib/ckan/bin/paster --plugin=ckan search-index rebuild -r -c /etc/ckan/production.ini

   Replace ``/usr/lib/ckan/bin/`` with the path to the ``bin`` directory of the
   virtualenv that you've installed CKAN into, and replace ``/etc/ckan/production.ini``
   with the path to your CKAN configuration file.

   The ``@hourly`` can be replaced with ``@daily``, ``@weekly`` or
   ``@monthly``.


Retrieving Tracking Data
========================

Tracking summary data for datasets and resources is available in the dataset
and resource dictionaries returned by, for example, the ``package_show()``
API::

  "tracking_summary": {
      "recent": 5,
      "total": 15
  },

This can be used, for example, by custom templates to show the number of views
next to datasets and resources.  A dataset or resource's ``recent`` count is
its number of views in the last 14 days, the ``total`` count is all of its
tracked views (including recent ones).

You can also export tracking data for all datasets to a CSV file using the
``paster tracking export`` command. For details, run ``paster tracking -h``.

.. note::

 Repeatedly visiting the same page will not increase the page's view count!
 Page view counting is limited to one view per user per page per day.


Sorting Datasets by Popularity
==============================

Once you've enabled page view tracking on your CKAN site, you can view datasets
most-popular-first by selecting ``Popular`` from the ``Order by:`` dropdown on
the dataset search page:

.. image:: images/sort-datasets-by-popularity.png

The datasets are sorted by their number of recent views.

You can retrieve datasets most-popular-first from the
:doc:`CKAN API </api>` by passing ``'sort': 'views_recent desc'`` to the
``package_search()`` action. This could be used, for example, by a custom
template to show a list of the most popular datasets on the site's front page.

.. tip::

 You can also sort datasets by total views rather than recent views. Pass
 ``'sort': 'views_total desc'`` to the ``package_search()`` API, or use the
 URL ``/dataset?q=&sort=views_total+desc`` in the web interface.


Highlighting Popular Datasets and Resources
===========================================

Once you've enabled page view tracking on your CKAN site, popular datasets and
resources (those with more than 10 views) will be highlighted with a "popular"
badge and a tooltip showing the number of views:
