Apps & Ideas
============

Since 1.7 CKAN has a feature called Apps & Ideas which allows users to provide information on apps, ideas, visualizations, articles etc that are related to a specific dataset. Once created these items will be shown against the dataset but also shown on the apps dashboard which will allow users to filter the results based on popularity, or type, or the data when the items were created.

This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled using the :ref:`ckan.dataset.show_apps_ideas` setting to hide the tab on the dataset pages.
