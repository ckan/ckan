Removes _internal_test_request_context.

CKAN will no longer silently push a test request_context when calling for `url_for`, from now on
it will need to be explicitly created if it is needed. If a URL is needed in test just write
exactly the URL you're trying to test in the request instead of generating it. (Or call for
url_for inside a test_request_context)
