A full history of dataset changes is now displayed in the Activity Stream to
admins, and optionally to the public. By default this is enabled for new
installs, but disabled for sites which upgrade (just in case the history is
sensitive). When upgrading, open data CKANs are encouraged to make this
history open to the public, by setting this in production.ini:
``ckan.auth.public_activity_stream_detail = true``
