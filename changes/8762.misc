The PSQL pool could be improved in order to avoid unnecessary connections.  
The default value for `sqlalchemy.pool_recycle` is -1 meaning that the
connections are never recycled. This can lead to problems with long-lived
connections. It'll be good to define `sqlalchemy.pool_recycle = 3600` as
default to recycle connections after 1 hour.  
Also, there is a commit after a read-only query that looks like an error.
