Dataset collaborators: In addition to traditional organization-based permissions, CKAN instances can also enable
the dataset collaborators feature, which allows dataset-level authorization. This provides
more granular control over who can access and modify datasets that belong to an organization,
or allows authorization setups not based on organizations. It works by allowing users with
appropriate permissions to give permissions to other users over individual datasets, regardless
of what organization they belong to. To learn more about how to enable it and the different 
configuration options available, check the documentation on :ref:`dataset_collaborators`.
