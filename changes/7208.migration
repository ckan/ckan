* The default format for accepted uploads for user, groups and organization images is now limited to PNG, GIF anf JPG. If you need to add additional foramts you can use the :ref:`ckan.upload.user.mimetypes` and :ref:`ckan.upload.group.mimetypes`) (`#7028 <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/7028>`_)
* Public user registration is disabled by default, ie users can not create new accounts from the UI. With this default value, new users can be created by being invited by an organization admin, being created directly by a sysadmin in the ``/user/register`` endpoint  or being created in the CLI using ``ckan user add``. To allow public registration see :ref:`ckan.auth.create_user_via_web`, but it's strongly encouraged to put some measures in place to avoid spam. (`#7028 <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/7028>`_)
