`datastore_create`, `datastore_upsert`, and `datastore_delete` now accepts `include_records` to return inserted/deleted records in the return dict, this defaults to False and `datastore_upsert` no longer includes `records` in the return dict by default. `datastore_create`, `datastore_upsert`, and `datastore_delete` with `"include_records": True` will now include the actual data inserted/updated in the return dict's `records` (`deleted_records` for `datastore_delete`). The returned records now include the `_id` column and all field values after processing by any database triggers. Formerly the records returned were only a copy of the values passed by the caller.
