When ``ckan.cache_enabled`` is set to ``False`` (default) all requests include the ``Cache-control: private`` header. If ``ckan.cache_enabled`` is set to ``True``, when the user is not logged in and there is no session data, a ``Cache-Control: public`` header will be added. For all other requests the ``Cache-control: private`` header will be added. Note that you will also need to set the ``ckan.cache_expires`` config option to allow caching of requests.
